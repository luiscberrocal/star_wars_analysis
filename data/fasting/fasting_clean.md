today's talk is very controversial okayyou're not gonna get a cardiologisttalking about not eating and fasting sothis is the unusual but this is breakingground because we are always looking for newways to treat all diseases. Treatingdiseases for illness nature has to booksomething in there people got betterpeople got ill people got better somepeople of course died but there must bemechanisms built into the body that makeyou better and what I'm trying to dohere is to tap into nature to see ifthere's anything in fasting. First Iheard about it going through medicalschool as a fasting can't be fastingcan't work fasting obviously doesnothing people don't eat because theydidn't have foodthe faster because the priests told himnot to fast they were fasting becausethey had seven children and food foronly five but the more I studied it andlooking at the biochemistry being ascientist I got to substantiate a lot ofthe things that I say and if I'm goingto look at the mechanisms I can't justcome up with them I got a look at thebiochemistry behind it so what I've donehere is I've made a summary pretty muchand I have no slice today because I wasin surgery right now until lateafternoon and never got a chance tofinish off my slides but I promise youall that just like the last two onesthis is being recorded and we'll put theslides in later on maybe in the nextweek and then we'll put it up as aproper slide presentation with thelecture in the background so it'll bejust like the previous ones I hope youall enjoyed the previous two that arealready on YouTubeso so with fasting if we look back inhistory we've been fasting all along andSocrates was asked why he fasted and hefasted for mental clarity so do you getmental clarity when you fast well hecertainly did and yet the prevailingwisdom is that when you're fast oh I'mgonna get sleepy I'm gonna get tired Ineed energy and eat this energy barsthere's those little drinks energydrinks and when you drink that you'resupposed to get energy and it's not truewhen you go and take a candy or anenergy bar you suddenly feel greatthat's because you're a junkieyou just got your high you just took ashot that boosted your your brainsdopamine levels and you went to thereward center and that's what you feltbetter because you are a sugar junkiethat's why you felt good becausebiochemically there's no parameter thatis measured in that patient to say thatyep he's lacking energy and now he tookthis shot whatever it was with it'sthose energy shots or an energy bar andnow he feels great so something'schanged none this has been shown inanimals in human beings clearly there'sno biochemical change going onnone whatsoever it's all in here it'smental so what happens is that when youissue the junkie whenever you eat sugaror simple carbohydrates and you get thathigh it goes to the dopamine center inthe brain produces all that dope incitywards Center and you get addicted toit and then you need it and then youfeel better when you take it so when youare fasting also you're feeling tiredand fatigued and it's there are reasonsfor that but taking another shot ofsugar or taking another candy is not thesolution it's nothing to do with thatit's the reward center and eventuallyafter a few days you will come out ofthat habit just like you take analcoholic and stick him in a roomthey can't drink anymore after a fewdays you won't crave anymore it's yourcravingit's your craving so one thing is abiochemical craving the second thing isyour Pavlovian reflexes where it's 12o'clock you got to go down to thedoctors loungeyou gotta eat are you hungry no I'm nothungry but I gotta eatit's time to eat it's evening I have toeat I'm not hungry but I have to eat soa lot of our behavior is incongruent ofphysiology our brain has interfered ourmind has interfered with our body and westopped listening to our body why did westop listening to the body because youwere told to stop listening to your bodyby who were you told the press the mediapeople around you maybe your parentsmaybe your friends and you gotta eatfive times a day five times a day maybesix times a day you gotta eatthis knowledge is totally false youdon't have to eat six times a day youdon't need to have that calorie inputall the time this is not right Ohbreakfast is the best the most importantmeal of today it's not it's not the mostnutritious meal of the day is the mealthat you have that's it end of storybut if you want to create a specialbreakfast mealyou're gonna develop a cereal and you'regonna say this is special breakfast foodalmost sounds like dog food rightcreate this food for the dogs now yougot a special food for breakfast youdon't need a special breakfast foodespecially one that's full of caloriesand sugar and is totally processedcompletely so so really they've been alot of myths about this so going back inhistory men only so first of all I wannatell that you are all very old all ofyou extremely old and how old are youreally well you know about two and ahalf million years old yes that's prettyold and about twelve thousand years agoyou changed and you started going intoagriculture so until then you are aPaleolithic being when you eat mostlymeat some vegetables that you found anddrank lots of water and when you arePaleolithic being none of you are suchfantastic hunters that you could huntand eat and kill every three hours sofor all those years millions of yearsright you generated a genetics thatgenetics is what you still have foundbecause it was evolved over two and ahalf million years so in the last twelvethousand years you became moreintelligent and started agriculture sonow your food changed so when you intoagriculture did your genetics keep upwith your two and a half million yearsof genetic change hardly because ittakes another two and a half millionyears to develop a new genetic packageyou did not change genetically as yourdiet change but you continued to be anagricultural society because thepopulation grew and was hard and harderso agriculture is easy and easier andthen in the last 200 years you changeyour diet again now you areindustrialized and now you start eatingprocessed foods vegetables seed oils Itold you about that before in a previouslecturetotally processed you need masssome factories to produce vegetable seedoils it is so processed and yet now weconsume that like it's going out ofstyle all of you consume vegetable seedoils whether you like it or not becauseit's in all processed foods and yet thatfood if you look at your entireevolution as 24 hours that food onlycame to you in the last 10 millisecondshow do you expect your body to respondgenetically and hormonal e to that foodthat you only just introduced to yourgenetics so before you put anything newin your mouth you got to decide that isthis in keeping with my genetics soreally this is very thought-provokingeven agricultural products it's verythought-provoking agricultural productsare fine but what did we do with them inthe year 1880 we invented the steel milland we made the flour and when we madeflour we changed the glycemic index ofthe food completely completely and thatwas a study that I talked to you aboutbefore so we've changed as we've movedalong so our diets have completelychanged the Paleolithic being 8 maybeonce a day and he ate during the daytime by the way because if we try to eatat night time where the caucus isoutside the hyenas or some other animalwill want to share that with youprobably make you their meal as wellthat night then you have to crawl intoyour cage I mean into your cave yougotta crawl into your cave and staythere and don't come out to drink watereither but nobody take the bottled waterwith us to bed so our body is made tofast and is made to feast and I willconvince you tonight that you should befasting and feasting as well because ifthere was no food around and if yoursugar just went down down down down downyour energy down went downtown thatwe'll be dead in 24 hours because you'regoing to your cam and you'll just crawlin and you just gonna get terriblebecause Nature doesn't give you any wayto come back or there's been no food for24 hours I'm just gonna crawl here Ihave no energy I have no nothing I'mjust gonna crawl and die but no thatdoes not happen to you fasting doesn'tkill people and in fact I asked you tofast all the time and I asked you tocome for a stress test you don't come onthe stresses and die so so this we areused to fasting and we do itand when you're sick you fast don't youwhen you have the flu you don't eat whenyour pets are sick didn't eat you don'tsee your dog running and eating his foodand his sake he stays in the corner andhe does not eat there's a wisdom in thatand that wisdom is the physiology thephysiology of the body is saying that heknows you know eating is dangerouseating takes up a lot of energy eatingtakes up if you put in about a hundredcalories of food into your body it takesabout 60 to 70 calories of your body todigest that food and then you get alittle excess so eating is an energyconsuming activity but most of us don'tthink of it I read you just in that allthat eating is gonna go right in and dome all that good a lot of energy thatgoes into iteating is dangerousit's true eating is dangerous so once ina while when you donate Nature has putinto you a biochemistry so let's let'sjust dive right into that biochemistry alittle bit so the first thing that'sgonna happen is that you stop eating inthe first 12 hours your body's gonna sayhmm no food coming out it's gonna wipeup all the glycogen that is in yourliver and in your muscles that's anormal process it's going to useglycogen so your sugar level or yourglucose levels will be maintained whatabout protein you got plenty protein inyour bodywhat about vitamins you got at least amonth's worth of vitamins in your bodywhat about energy how much fat do I havedo you know that I have in effect in mybody to last me at least 40 days so Ihave plenty energy in me I have about50,000 calories stored inside me whichcan be used but I need to unlock thosecalories in the form of fat so you eatyou store in the form of fat and thatfat should be utilized now so for thefirst 12 hours I'm not going to use thefact I'm going to use up my glycogenstores how am I gonna feel I'm gonnafeel okayunless I'm a junkie then I'm gonna wantto eat you know that's junk enos becauseyour sugar will never drop I'm gonna saythat again your sugar will never dropyou can fast for seven days your bloodsugar will come down but you will notbecome hypoglycemic and have an attackunless you're on insulin or you'retaking diabetes medications so how doesthe body keep the sugar but I told youthat in the first 12 hours you getglycogen after 12 hours what happens youget gluconeogenesis that means newglucose is being made gluconeogenesiswhereas that glucose come from thatcomes into the bloodstream where does itcome from comes from protein but it'snot the protein in the muscles proteinis always being turned over in your bodybut this time the protein that'snormally gonna turn over turns into blueso your glucose level is maintained foranother 12 hours or so during this next12 hours as a small increase in ketosisso let me explain ketosis to you wheredoes that come from so what happens isthat the body senses that you have verylittle food coming in and I'm going toexplain to you how that happens how doesthe body know that there's no food it'snot just the sugar I will explain thisjuice not sugar so what happens is thatnow the fats in your body say okay weare here utilize us the only way fat cancome into utilization is the insulinlevels must drop so the insulin levelsare now low because you're not eatingwhen your insulin level is high youstore energy when your insulin levelsare low you pull energy out of the fatsso now through the hormonal action ofyou know hormone sensitive lipase andthe action of LPL what happens at fatstores open up because your insulinlevel is low so the fats start beingdevoured the fat gets converted totriglyceridesand fatty acids the fatty acids floodthe bloodstream you can utilize fattyacids so they go to your liver and inthe liver your fatty acids get convertedto ketones there's two ketonesbeta-hydroxybutyrate acid and acetoneacetic acid these two ketones now go upketones can be utilized by the body andthis is the great breakthrough that Iwant to tell you that ketones can beutilized by every cell of your bodyincluding your brain you are told thatthe brain is an obligate glucoseutilizer can only utilize glucose it'sabsolutely wrong there was a study donein Britain where what they did is thatthey brought the blood sugar down to 30but they pumpfull of ketones and we were all sittingand talking and having fun and not asweat the only one that was sweating wasthe doctors the blood sugar you shouldbe having convulsion is the brain canutilize ketones after a seven-day fast70 per-- 70% of the energy utilizationof the brain is through ketones and thebrain likes itand there's even studies to show thatwhen the brain utilizes the ketones itactually is a cleaner burn it burns morecleanly so what happens if there's aslow increase in the ketones whichactually starts around 18 hours andgradually goes up up up up up upso by 24 hours you have some ketonesmaybe 10 15 % of your entire energysource is now gonna be ketones how areyou gonna feel with ketones just fine noproblem you feel you feel okay becauseketones are giving you all the energythat you need then let's say another 12hours go by so you know at the 35 hourslet's say now the ketones go even higherand higher and higher and by 3 daysyou're Peter mills are really beginningto get even better and even higher so bythe fifth day of fasting you will have alot of Tito's now you can measure yourketones in your urine so you get alittle dipstick and you can buy this bythe way it only costs a few dollars andyou just test your urine to see when youbecome ketogenic and you can test it nowif you've been on a low-carb diet lowsugar diet you will go into ketogenesisearlier than somebody who eats a lot ofsugar because it's got a whole bunch ofglycogen in his liver because you got toremember go through the glycogen firstbefore you start burning ketones sosomeone who's on a very low carb diethe's going to kill us in Genesis muchfaster so he's the ketones and thekiddos will keep getting utilized thefats will keep burning soonare you doing the right arithmetic thatokay fine I've used up my currentaccounts I'm going to my deposit accountnow and I'm drawing money from mydeposit account now what what preventsus all from utilizing my deposit accountits insulin because I told you instantholds the key to opening up the fencedoors so you want to utilize your fatstores you have to drop your insulinlevels now how am I gonna drop your fillyour insulin is right now there's onlyone way for me to drop your insulinlevels and that's to put you on afascinating program so now you choosewhich fasting program you want to be ondo you want to do alternative a fastingdo you want to do 18 hour fast do youwant to do a three day fast I mean howdo you want to do this and that'ssomething we'll talk about and see whatcan but what am I saying here what's thetrigger here which is which is a hormonein the body that's the elephant in theroomit's insulin just like my last talk Itold you about do you see how it's allcoming togetherthe fats the sugar the weight thefasting it's all insulin it's all aboutinsulin you don't so somebody who'staking insulin show me somebody whotakes incident every day and oh yeah Ican lose weight just like that theycan't lose weight they cannot I've doneit I've given insulin for 25 years to mypatients and I yelled at them andnothing happens so long as the insulinlevels are high they cannot lose weightand let me tell you something else themortality is also higher now them toattack two diabetics okay not type 1diabetics type 1 diabetics are used indeficient and they need the insulinreplacement but type 2 diabetics alreadyhave a high insulin level and they haveinsulin resistance so the instant isalready high and now you're giving themmore insulin and that is only gonna hurtthe patient even more but you're a 1 Cwould look better and your glucose willbe lower but show me the data that yoursurvival is gonna be paralyzed show methat you're gonna get less sales Imusshow me that you're gonna get lessinflammation in your body coronaryartery diseaserates it's all about the insulin guys isall about the insulin so you got to in achronic said nobody in the hospital andyou're having DK or some other medicalproblems that you having surgery andyou're getting on steroids and yoursugar levels are highI'll give you an insulin but that's atemporary thing to bring it down becauseI want your sugar levels to be idealwhile I'm doing surgery on you becausehigh sugar levels mean poor recovery soI want your ideal sugar levels butthat's a different storyI am talking about people who have highinsulin levels because of insulinresistance and you cannot give them moreinsulin so you must get your insulinlevel down I don't have a drug to giveyou to bring your insulin level down butfasting will bring your instant leveldown because if you don't eat you're notgoing to make insulin now what's gonnahappen is that as your instant leveldrops and it's nice and low your bodywill become sensitive to the insulinjust like when any level goes down withthem system it when there's too much ofit your receptors down regulates I'm notgoing to respond to this so after youeat in a normal state you produce a lotof incident let's say now that you'vebeen down for a good period of timelet's say I'm gonna give an example 24hours your insulin levels have been lownow you eat that next meal you're onlygonna make this much insulin you canmake a much less amount of insulin soyour body is gonna deal with that mealdifferently then had you eaten in a fedstate so eating after a fast ismetabolized totally different thaneating in an fed state it's much moreforgiving to you and what's going tohappen is that you produce less and lessinsulin even in the next few days afteryour fasted one day look at the rewardsI'm telling you aboutyou ought to diet at least one day whereyou don't eat anything because it willgive you a sustained benefit for daysbecause the instant sensitivity is goingto be improved so what happens here isthat insulin stays nice and low yourbody becomes more sensitive tothe insulin produces less insulin so youyou're not locking the fat stores inkeep burning fat which is what you wantto do so here's a reason to fast ifyou're overweight do you want to get ridof the fat fine this is the way to do itwell why don't you just do caloricrestriction so still eat five times aday but it's more amounts you cannot dothat you lose a little bit but you losemuch more muscle and you lose some fatyou will feel miserable your metabolicrate will go down and your body resetsitself and you'll gain all that weightright back again because that's notnatural because when you are aPaleolithic me you didn't just go andnever let the carcass and say okay I'llcome back here and eat five times anight you don't do that it's justtotally unnatural to do that and thebody's physiology is in keeping withthat so the biochemist just telling methe same thing that you are you notsupposed to do that so you're supposedto eat eat when the food is availablewhich is usually once a day now let'ssay what other benefit am I gonna getbesides the insulin and utilizing thefact well the body says that okay thispoor person hasn't had a kill today sohe's calling to his cage well I got toget him out of there can I get him outby decreasing his metabolic rate no Iincrease his metabolic rate how do I dothat after a fast or during that fastespecially after 18 hours yourepinephrine levels increase youradrenaline levels go up your cortisollevels go up your metabolic rate goes upyou start feeling better morebushy-tailed bright-eyed because you'relooking for your next kill because ifyou walk out there with your eyes howdroopy you're gonna see the killthe deal will roll walk right by you andyou won't have any energy to chase itbut now you full up you pumped up yourmetabolic rate is high you more alertyou awake and you will get you killedthere's another thing that happens whenyou're fast you produce a stuff called Bbrain-derived neurotropic factor so whathappens is that the body startsproducing a hormone that goes to yourbrain and tells your brain switch on andyou actually make new brain cells youactually make new brain cells show me adrug that's gonna make new brain cellsso in a fasting situation make new braincells because nature wants to teach youthat the cell you got into the situationlearn from itremember it and now get out and getanother kill see it makes you better itmakes your brain better what else does afasting do growth hormone so do you knowhow much growth hormone costs a smallpoint one injection is about $400 pointone point one is four hundred dollarsit's so expensive right but did you knowthat if you're fast just a one and ahalf to two days there's a two day fastin the study a two day fast produced atwo thousand percent increase in yourgrowth hormone production in a man and1300 in a woman so it is the best way toboost your growth hormone level now whywould I want growth hormone becausegrowth hormone is the hormone that keepsyou youngit's a growth hormone that makes yourskin matter that replaces the dead partsbetter and you muscles grow so yourmuscles actually grow so you do you do10 reps you're gonna put on more musclethan if your growth hormone is lowgrowth hormone is low you could bepumping iron all day long and you'lljust get 80 muscles but you will notgrow muscles to grow muscles you needgrowth alone you want to stay youngeryougrowth hormone now there is a conditioncalled adult growth hormone deficiencyand of course children have it too andthey have short stature and slow growthetc and in adults is a similar one andit manifests itself as an elderly personwho is just his muscles are all wastedhe's got no energy he's got a blank inhis in his eye all the time he's justcan't think and he's very weakhe's just sitting around you met hisgrowth hormone level it's very low yougave him some growth hormonehe feels not better but the problem withexogenously Moniz has no side effects sothat's why right now it's not approvedby the FDA for me to give people growthhormone but the best way to giveyourself growth hormone is to do onefast do one fats and your growthhormones will go up what else happenswhen you're fasting so growth home and Itold you about 20 24 to 48 hours if youreally want to get the full benefit ofgrowth hormone now there's a conditioncalled etapa G I'm gonna explain to atoughie G is a tompa G starts actuallyat about 18 hours and then graduallyincreases and it's maximum at 3 days itsounds terrible it's not fair but youknow what even if I get some etapa Gafter 24 hours I'll be very very veryhappy by phone a maximized merit RPGI'll go for a three day fast so let meexplain what a Tophet is a tapa G theNobel Prize winner got it you got or twoyears ago the price on the top of G sowhat happens in the topic is that whenyou are nutrient deficient like this thebody senses that there's no nutrientscoming in and there's a thin thingcalled M tall M 2 levels go reallyreally low this is a a protein kinase inthe body and it goes really really lowand that turns on a toffee G what turnsoff Futaba G is M 2 levels are high whatcauses M 2 levels to go high is eatingmostly proteinsso let's come back again to a top of youso what a tapa G does is that it takesyour cells and the cell has alipoprotein membrane around it andthere's all the intracellular organellesin it but in the course of time thosecells the intracellular organelles someof them become redundant there's proteinlying around this whenever this workthere's gonna be garbageso there are old intracellularorganelles and some proteinaceousmaterials that are just lying on in thecytoplasm so the body says I need energyrecycle I need to recycle so the firstthing it does the cell stays alive andit takes those intracellular organellesbreaks them down packages them into thelysosome and digests it breaks it downinto its pieces so whether it's thesarcoplasmic reticulum or otherintracellular organelles breaks them alldown and exports it out of the cellonce it's exported from the cell intothe bloodstream the bloodstream says ahaI've got some new building blocks nowand the body he utilizes that okay sothe body now starts utilizing yourinterest cellular organelles so you'rerecycling yourself so your cell isdoesn't die it goes into a state ofrecycling and you recycle yourmitochondria as well so mitochondrialots because there's a lot of oxidativestress going on in the mitochondria sowhat happens is that it that cell is nowgoing to be deplete of its oldnon-functional parts and then when youdo it guess what we get to be repairedfirst all those organelles so youbasically rejuvenate yourselves now ifyou're constantly eating you will notrejuvenate those cells and thebiochemistry is so beautiful that thesecells now are functioning better theyounger and they are going to lastthe more resilient also to disease I'llcome to that in a minuteso a tapa G makes yourselves betteryounger restoration it's like it's likea reset switch so how do this organizedredo themselveswell they reboot themselves because whenyou then eat because you've had a tapa Ga signal goes from those cells to thebone marrow to say hey listen I used upmy intracellular organelles when you getnew ones new supplies send them to meso the bone marrow when you eat makesstem cells have you ever stem cells nowcost you million dollars just go out andget some now cost you a whole lot ofmoney and it won't work because when youinject stem cells from the outside theresidence rates are wrong because theydidn't get the message of where to go toit's all artificial so it doesn't knowso the brain look I injected brain stemcells in the heart and pages aboutcutting functions I was here doing thestudy upstairs and what was theresidence rate residence it is how manyof the stem cells actually ended up inthe muscle where I wanted it to stay andrepair the heart less than 0.1% did theejection prices go up no change inejection fraction so injecting stemcells from the outside does nothing foryou it was good to study with brain stemcells and it still is for the reasonthat you need to harness nature's way ofgiving your stem cells you want to stemcell transplant right now you're gonnafast it's the fastest way to increaseyour stem cells so these stem cells comeout of the bone marrowit's called refeeding reward and they gointo the into the organs and replenishcells that have died and change themachinery in those cells as well sothere's a whole rejuvenation process youare a younger better more resilientperson than you were before and this isall been documented over and over againbut there's no industry that'sgonna support me because there's nofinancial gain if you get better andyounger and live longer because there'sno one there to make money out of no onemakes money when you fast they losemoney so boost your growth hormoneboosts your butt boost your stem cellsthis has been well-documented not onlyin humans in animals still welldocumented over and over again it's justthat nobody's ever heard of it anyonethinks that all fasting is just fastinga starvation is no good but there's somuch science behind this so the nextbenefit of course is stem cellmobilization that occurs and to get themaximum benefit of that you can't justdo you know overnight fast no you reallyneed to fast because for the bone marrowto say I'm gonna come in and replace yougot to really have reached that point ofreplacement so you can't you can't speedit up either so the question is can I doa three day fast of course I can do athree day fast you got to prepareyourself mentally you got to prepareyourself physically for the environmentmake sure that you know you you know youyou you with your best friends anenvironmentand you got to have water so that youdon't get dehydrated so you can do itall of us can do it so you can fast fordifferent reasons so when would I want atoffee gee I would want to talk with youone just to live longer number two letme tell you something if you do aseven-day water fastthe studies done in Boston at theUniversity showed that your lifetimeprobability of getting cancer is reducedby more than 70% some studies evenhigher because the cells that are gonnadie off in this date of the fast of thereal cancer cells because your cancercells look you don't do a PET scan onyou I'm gonna give you a radioactivematerials of glucose in it oh excuse methe glucose is really low and theinsulin level is very low so thenutrients that the cancer cells want arenot therecancer cells do die off so let's talkabout cancer for a secondso the studies have been done and if youfast a person only for 36 hours that'sit and then give them chemotherapy inthat state they're gonna tolerate thechemotherapy better they're gonna haveless side effects from the chemotherapyit's gonna be death of cancer cells andyour normal cells are more resilient nowand you're gonna get less death of yournormal cells you see what I'm sayingso what happens when you're fasting yournormal cells become more resilient soyou give the chemo only the week guysdie which is the cancer cells becauseyou've strengthened through this fastingprocess your normal cells so I wanted todo this protocol upstairs Ian's in thebone marrow unit where we do a lot ofchemotherapy on these patients but nonobody said okay going to this projectthey said we'll be inhumane to tell ourpatients to fast before we give themchemotherapy so what we do we feed themthen we get nauseated then they vomit sowe give them so friend and then we thenthey were still down there so thenTPN on them because we've all beenindoctrinated that we have to feed feetfeet feet feet I'm just telling you allright now if any of you get on mycurrently in fashion you get admitted tothe hospital I'm making your NPO I'llput any fluids on you I'll give you amake you NPO so even if you do farm atyou're not gonna aspirate you know howmuch aspiration is here in the hospitalover here in pneumonia and all that fromaspirin is terrible because I'm forcedfeeding you in a sense wait a secondyour body is not hungry don't eat butknow the trace get bored too you have toeat you don't have to if there's areason why you have anorexia when you'resick pay attention to your body yourbody's telling you don't eat then don'tneed you won't die you might die fromeating so cancer I predict that in thenext five to ten years is going to bemajor cancer treatments associated withadjunct of fasting and that's comingdefinitelyit's on its way what else can be usefulautoimmune diseases this numerousstudies to show that you haveinflammatory bowel disease rheumatoidarthritis lupus any of these conditionsand you get a flare-up of it fast forthree days it's the most potent thingyou can do as an anti-inflammatorybecause first and foremost your bowelsare totally quiet there's no energybeing used for digestionyour body's energy resources will beutilized to repair yourself a lot ofautoimmune diseases start from your gutas well gives you a gut a chance to healso that you get less leaky gut syndromeso that that fast actually heals itgives it to your gut a chance to heal aswell autoimmune diseases get better thenwhat about diabetes diabetes definitelygets better because I just told you theinsulin resistance gets betterso that gets better what about theAlzheimer's oh yeah you know poor grannywe can't pull the tray away from her butsometimes the best thing you couldactually do give you lots of liquids anddon't feed granny for three daysif she's got dementia social serviceswill be after you it could be anybodynot just a granny but don't beat her forthree days just give a lots of water Ipromise youneurologically she'll start waking upthe fog will go away the confusion willget better you can't get better and itshould get better and there's no hummingtrying because you won't die in threedaysso today water fast so what I mean bythe water fast three day water fast thatmeans you can only drink water for threedays so drink lots of water now why doyou need to think so much water becauseall the reactions occur in water andsecondly you appear lock when you'refasting I'm not drinking that much I'mnot eating and how come I'm peeing somuch it's because when your insulinlevels go down insulin holds onto waternow there's no more insulin so thatwater gets diarist out of your body soyou will notice that you pee a lot soyou need to drink more when you'refasting there's number one now what whatelectrolyteswell electrolytes will be conserved byyour kidneys if kidneys are very good atholding on to LED lights so there'splenty LED lights in the body 0:35sodium if I don't take in sodiumthe last molecule of sodium will bereabsorbed by my tipping's not a singlemolecule will be in my urine that's howgood it isso kidneys will take care of everythingthe kidneys will not allow you to losesodium or potassium now if you're readystarting out with a half empty plateyeah you may get some depletion but youcan get that tested and on refeeding youI'll give you some clues on how toimprove that when you refill yourselfbut it's unusual to get electrolyteimbalance but if you do get it take apinch of salt in the water and you'llfind that your cramps get better andyour dizziness gets better and yourheadaches get better so these arecomplaints a lot of patients have theirall you know it's fasting but mine afterfifteen hours I had a bad headache we'regoing three more water with a little bitof salt in it and put Himalayan saltbecause that also has some magnesium andother things in itand you'll feel a lot better dizzinessis usually due to low blood pressurebecause your blood pressure comes downso you get dizzy when you're fastingit's not because your Sugar's down it'sbecause your blood pressure's low drinkwater and cramps some patient getscramps put the salt again and also inthe evening put yourself in a tub of ofepsom salts or you can get somemagnesium and there's there's a liquidmagnesium you can just put on your skinyou can spray it and they'll give youmagnesium and that's what it's all aboutso give yourself salt so magnesiumyou'll start feeling better patientssaid oh I get so hungrywell hunger comes and goes there's aghrelin increase in decrease accordingto the circadian cicle so all you haveto do is pay attention yes I'm hungryalright drink some water expand yourstomach and you'll feel better half anhour later the hungers gone keep yourmind busy get going do something haveyour chores get get them done yourhunger will go away patients don'tcontinue to be hungry all day long itjust doesn't happen if they are cravingis again like I told you they'd bePavlovian reflex or they've become ajunkie so hunger comes hunger goes mostpatients find the second day the hardestand then from the third day onward theyactually feel good and the third andfourth day of fasting fourth day theyfeel phenomenal on the fifth day theythey want to go running you want to goto the gym they feel wonderful so yougot to get over that hump if you reallywant to do that tap over fast you haveto know that I'm gonna face a problemon the second day is gonna be hardestthird fourth fifth day after better sowho should do the wrong fast and whoshould just do intermittent fasting sofirst and foremost if you just want tobe healthy it wants a day at the mosttwice a day in a six toour window period so that's called timerestricted feeding so if you just wantgeneral maintenance you want to lose alittle bit of weight you want to stayhealthy you don't want to become adiabetic you don't want diseases ofmodern man then start eating lessfrequently start learning how to eatonce a day or twice a day in a six-hourwindow period so if you're gonna havelunch at 1 o'clockyou should have dinner at 6 or 7 o'clockand that's it no snacking in betweenbecause every snack will increase yourinsulin levels and it breaks your fastand your ketogenesis as well so on adaily basis it will give you a littlebit of a toffee g will give you a littlebit of ketosis and you'll burn fat youyour body will learn how to take food inwhen you eating and then burn theglycogen and then for about 4 hours orso it will pull out some from the fat soit took this a nice cycle there thenonce a week you can extend that furtherby just skipping the evening meal alsoso instead of a 24-hour fast it becomesa 36-hour fast once a week that willgive you a huge boost in your immunityyou'll find you won't get the flu[Music]immunity will get better because yourimmunise i'ts are now new because yourstem cells have kicked in 36 hours is amagic number and it's doable to telleverybody to do a three-day fast it'skind of tough for a 5 day fast butpeople have done this some of mypatients have done 7-day fasts you'resome people with whom I communicate withmy iPhone all the time 14-day fasts butthey're doing it because they absolutelydiseases so they have a lot of chronicdisease that they want to get rid of andthey do it and they're doing it don'tread a lot they'll do a 7 day fast everysix months that's it you don't have toknow the rest of the time they doingtime restricted feeding because theyhave these chronic diseases ofAlzheimer's or diabetes or they getI've had two cancers already or theywant to just lose a lot of weight andthey want to get rid of that highinsulin level so eating in a timerestricted period that's good for all ofus I think that our life revolves aroundeating too much and we've been we'vebeen bamboozled by by industry and byjust all sorts of nonsense out there andthere's a growing community thatunderstands this so I just want to giveyou a little bit of chemistry on ourtically with some chemistry so how doesthe body know that you didn't eatbecause all of you think oh it's chickenmy sugar will go down that's how my bodyknew that I don't need right nice andMolly do do that your body knows whatyou ate how did it know what you ate howmuch protein how much fat how much sugarit's very complicated but one of thethings is your nad which is you're oneof those little molecules insideyourselves and it looks at the ratio ofnad to NADH and that is determined a lotby how much fat metabolism is going onin yourself which occurs in themitochondria and how much glycolysis isoccurring in your cytosol long and shortof it you don't need to know all thatall you need to know is your body knowswhat you ate so when you are in afasting state they mobilize a bunch ofenzymes or proteins called the sirt1molecules si R T - 1 molecules they goout in your body in a fasting state andin that state it binds to a sitar grooveknow what's so important about that sowhen the Sun is up it binds with acetylgroups on your histones which are onyour DNA so you all know this is justfollow me on this because this is reallyit's exciting because if you know theknowledge behind this to get excitedabout itand you'll want to do it so you hopeyour your your DNA you have your fullset ofyou name of which you only express afraction less than 1% all the rest ofyour DNA is all covered up with thehistones histones are like a springthat's over your DNA and doesn't exposeit so what the search does it binds totheir star groups and it untwisthistones in certain parts of your DNA sothat that part of the DNA can startmaking proteins so it's calledexpression your genetic expressionchanges because now you're making newproteins so you see how your dietaffects which genes are now going to beexpressed and those genes make proteinsand that's how they carry out the effectin your body so the third one actuallyactivates a gene called the Fox oh threegene and this Foxoh three gene activates many other genesand this is what those genes do is veryexciting it activates all theantioxidant genes in your body naturallynaturally so you don't need to go buyvitamin C and vitamin E and all thesethings and yeah so what activates Fox o3alsoturmeric does then you think turmeric isa antioxidant it is but through themechanism it turns on a certain gene initself it has no antioxidant propertieswhy why am i doing vitamin 3 d3 levelson everybody in my office because one ofthis the most important vitamin involvedwith gene expression is vitamin D if youvitamin D deficient your gene expressionis handicapped so when things happen toyouor when you're not eating or when youget sick your body is genetic materialcannot reveal itself in a normal waythat you're supposed to do just wannasay about vitamin D you handicap inyourself in your own ability to repairyour body because your vitamin Ddeficient and I can tell you right nowninetyyou I knew in this room a vitamin Ddeficient 90% of your vitamins did I canI can tell you that for sure that's aall of you have to get your vitamin Dlevels done and you need to be takingvitamin d3 if you are low and you didn'tbe sitting in the Sun for 10 minutesevery day you gotta do this you cannotguess what your vitamin D level is youneed to check it so vitamin D isinvolved in over 300 different reactionsand most of them got to do a geneticexpression heck I want to know thatbecause I want to express my scenes tothe best of their ability and make themresponsive to everything that's going onso the Fox Oh 3 gene is very importantantioxidant gene then the next gene isDNA repair so it activates my DNA repairmechanisms because my DNA is bombardedevery day by radiation by toxins by byfood also and my DNA crumbles every daythat's why I get old so that's no goodso it makes you younger so Fox o3prepares your DNA makes your telomeresless short so they stay nice and longand you know that telomeres are veryimportant right because the longer theyare the longer you gonna live apoptosisapoptosis is cell programmed death ofthe cells so it controls that clearanceof senescence cells that's a pop that'sa etapa G getting rid of all cellsbecause you don't all cells hanging onin your system so old cells get clearedaway as well then protein structure andmaintenancethis is LC mers disease what is theawesomest exam as the brain cells don'twork pretty good why don't they workvery good because there's aproteinaceous material that is built upinside it and that kind of hurts themechanisms of your brain cellsthat's amyloid amyloid deposition thisis involved with that too and then stemcell mobilization brain-derivedneurotropic factor all these things Ialready mentioned they all through theFox all three mechanism you want to getgood Fox oh three you need to havevitamin D in your system and you need tobe ethe right food and the right food meansno processed foods everything that wasthere two and a half million years agovegetables some fruit about our talkabout fruits overrated so what happensis that at the end of the summer andfall the fruit is bearing there and yousupposed to eat the fruit with all thatfructose to get you through winter butwinter never comes so you keep eatingthroughout the year so and you keepgetting in the way so fruits are goodfor you but you so see it one food todaythat's it and choose the most colorfulfruits again and mix it up a little bitbut please don't donate five six foods aday I mean let's just this is crazy andeat fruit that have a low glycemic indexhigh glycemic index fruits arewatermelon all the melons that you haveall the stuff that they give you whenyou order fruit plate in the in therestaurant that's all that bad stuff allover there the kiwi fruit in it is badthe grapes are bad bananas are 50/50 butthe best things are apples peaches plumsapricots those are very healthy for youright because a lot of fiber and alsolow glycemic index so there you gopears pears are very good so now whatother agent helps you to express yourcert one better it's oh maybe three nowyou know why I'm so anal about omega-3levels they need weight so again I canpromise you not ninety five ninetypercent I think ninety-five percent ofyou in this room are probably by omega-3deficientnow it's not may not be an absolutedeficiency but the ratio of your omega-3to omega-6 is off it should be ideallyone to one but I bet you most of youabout 20 to 1 because omega-6 is foundin all the vegetable seed oils so whathappens is that this ratio is becausewhat happens at 3 & 6 compete for thesame substrate so you can be takingpicture of fine but if you're also usingvegetable oil you just dip itdefeated the purpose so Omega 3 alsolengthens your telomeres as that'svitamin D C simple measures simplethings what else lengthens your TRtelomeres and helps with your with withyour DNA is meditation meditationactually has been shown to increase yourtelomeres and lack of sleep shortensthem and melatonin I'll say somethingabout melatonin melatonin preventscancer but it also turns on Fox o3 so ifyou're not getting melatonin and you'renot getting sleep at night you're notgetting rejuvenation now you know themechanism of why you get so old becauseyou're only sleeping three hours a nightor four hours a night or worse still youdoing night shift or and all thosethings and therefore your sleep istotally dysfunctional but very veryimportant okay so now you know that thebody actually is very intelligent whatyou eat immediately starts changing yourgenetic expression did you ever thinkabout that I never thought about thatuntil I did all this research andstarted researching all this about fivesix years ago by diet I always thoughtthat I just changed my hormones by mymemory cholecystokinin my insulin whatmy genetic expression changes with everymeal that I ate yes it does it's veryempowering to know that don't forget itand pass it on so when you eat proteinsyou produce a stuff called insulin-likegrowth factor-1 now this is a warningtour of you okay too much protein willproduce too much igf-1 insulin-likegrowth factor-1that turns on mTOR I mentioned them tooearlier on and these are protein kinasesand what this does it stimulates yourribosomal production to make moreprotein which is good so when you eatprotein you make more muscles that'sfine but you also have cellproliferationand what that does it increases yourrisk of cancers now there's absolutelyno doubt that a high-protein dietincreases the risk of cancer I thinkthat data is unequivocal it's been shownin animals and also in some humanstudies now the mTOR also decreases @rgso if you are on a high-protein diet andyou think that you're getting a tapa geeyou've just turned it off because of Mtall because I mentioned that earlier onin my talk it turns off M tall so howmuch protein should you have well not alot how much is not a lot well you'renot growing you're not lactating you'veall passed pubertyyou know what bodybuilders 0.35 perpound that's it grams per pound so every150 so 50 grams of protein that's all Ineed and I'm going to get enough of thatin my regular diet taking protein powdernot a good idea not a good ideacut it out we did it we all did it I didit for a while you will notice the sugarlevels go up their stability yourinstant production as well and it's gota lot of glucose in it and it will causeeye gf1 levels to go up and it increasesprotein synthesis risk of cancer anddecreases etapa G now I just do that atappa G is so important and here thisthing turns it off don't do protein barsfor goodness sake you don't need it andnature doesn't give you protein on itsownit gives it to you in the form of me youwant some protein going to eat the meatyou want some protein going eat thechicken or the fish and make sure it'snice and lean and not fit on cornbecause then you'll get too much omega-6as well so there you go nowthey say so insulin and growth instantlike Pro 30 is just like growth hormoneso there's a group of people out thereinEquador and they they have the wrongsyndrome which is a gene mutation Igotta tell you about this what thatmeans is that they the growth hormonereceptor has a mutation so it doesn'twork very well so these people are veryshort the real short little stubby aswell but they live to be a hundredhundred ten and they have no cancer andno high blood pressure and it's all todo with that growth hormone receptormutation that is why we say that listenif you want that type of physiology youneed to cut down on the amount ofprotein you know it's overrated becauseyou go to restaurant and you order yoursalad and what's the first questionprotein no I don't need any protein inmy saladthank you but they'll always ask you forthat it's over at night I'm not sayingthat you shouldn't add some grilledchicken to your salad or something youcan do that but take it in the contextof how much protein you're eating duringthe day and please don't supplement evenmore unless you have illness unless youhave GI problems and you can't alwayseat and you're wasting away and yourteeth are really bad and I'm you sickyou might need some protein most of usdon't need it 99% of us don't need it soin those patients they have very lowinsulin levels very low instant likegrowth factor levels and there you go soyou have less diabetes less can say inthose patients so different diets turnthese genes on and off when you eatsugar you turn on a gene called Ras -PKAit's crazy so this is a protein kinaseas well and what does that do again itturns off etapa G increases theproduction of your insulin and basicallymakes you more inflammatory because itturns off all those things so you becomeinflammatory sugar causes inflammationin the bodyfructose causes insulin resistance inthe liver I went over that with you orbefore so sugar is very very bad for yousugar is a poison sugar is not naturalsugar was never found in nature it's atotally processed food it's processedit's as processed food as all the otherprocessed foods that we eat it's just asbut but people think should is just itsnatural sugar you know it's sugar wellit's not sugar it's process is totallyprocess is no such thing as sugarit's totally processed so if you don'twant cancer heart disease diabetesdeserve the joint disease inflammatoryconditions of the bowels then don't getolddon't get oh now why did I say thatbecause there's a lot of truth to whatI'm going to say here okay so all theseconditions are conditions that occur inaging if you can slow down aging youwon't get those conditions so what isthe best way to stay young your geneticmaterial and for you to constantly stayyoung but I told you already how to dothatfasting keep your weight down eat theright foods your genetic material stayyoung you stay younger you're not goingto get those five conditions if you getprematurely old and by your way we'regetting old fast it's 30 rolls and 9 and20 year olds coming into my office thenthey're already 50 years old because ofthe lifestyle what they eating theirlifestyle their sleep patterns theirstress patterns so don't get all soeverything that I'm saying is alsoanti-aging so now does that mean I'm ananti-aging doctor I ambut there's a lot of other people outthere also doing anti-aging but I'm adifferent anti-aging kind of doctor I domore naturally and I know the sciencebehind it so I'm not gonna tell you togo and you know take the special creamand put it on you and eat the specialconcoction because how natural is allthat just how natural is that I mean ifyou want to be natural then you don'twalk away from from one of thoseproviders with a bag load of drugs andcreams and and other things I mean hownatural is that I have nothing to sellyou I got nothing I have a vitamin D inmy officeI got vitamin k2 by the way you allshould be on vitamin k2 as well what isvitamin k2 and k2 takes the calciumtakes it out of the over all of yourtissues and puts it back into the boneweights below so how come you gotvitamin k2 deficiency because your we'reon that low-fat diet right so it'sabsorbed through fat you don't have fatyou're not good absorb vitamin K youdon't have fat you know car buyersabsorve item indeed how do you think youare became vitamin D deficient becausewe went on the slow fat craze no factorslow fat that so it compounded yournutritional deficiency when you went ona high carb diet which is what thegovernment told us to do because what wedid we went on a low-fat diet andsubstitute it all with carbs you alsobecame nutritionally a desert becauseyou didn't get all the good things lookwhen you eat natural fats in naturalways let's say you had a piece of fishyou eat meat or eating vegetables itcomes with everything in it so your adekwill get absorbed with the natural fatyou need it you need it and that's howit's gonna get absorb because that's howit was two and a half million years agowho are you to try to change this in thelast millisecond of your life in yourevolution okay so let's talk about thathow many generationswell before you because that was lookthat that will be an eye-opener for youI have it written down here somewhere inmy notes how many generations have goneby is it's a real eye-opener oh manwhether I write it oh yeah oh yeah hegoes so in the two and a half millionyears there were a hundred thousandgenerations and each generation improveson these genetic materials 100,000generations and then they produced theHomo Sapien how many generations were inthe agricultural time since theAgricultural thing happened only sixhundred generations so six hundredgenerations have been eating there thebenefits of the agricultural revolutionand what about the Industrial Revolutionwhich changed it even more becauseremember much of the agricultural wasokay actually because the grains werekind of whole but in the industrialrevolution how many generations havegone by only ten only ten you have nochance of survival because your geneticmaterial has another chance to even justsort of in ten generationsso you drastically change the way youlive you drastically change your dietand you expect ten generations todrastically change your genetic materialnow if you're lucky and you procreatewisely there may be another thousandgenerations from now your kids willadapt to this new diet but right now youstand a chance you see what I'm sayingkeep stay on this diet stay on thislifestyle and after another thousandmaybe two thousand three thousandgenerations the new human being willhave adapted to today's food you won'tstand a chanceso there you go all right so do how muchmore time do I have I have a little bitmore time so I want to give you a fewmore a few more hints so they hit on onon fasting and and things to say aboutfasting so I already talked about thebiochemical changes and I told you howso the first thing you need to do ifyour honor anyone wants to start afasting program is to cut down on yourcarbohydrates you cannot jump into afasting program with a regular diet youhave to first be carb conditioned youneed to cut down on unknown processedfoods no processed foodsnothing unnatural anything that'srefined no sugar no drinks except forwater and tea and coffee and by the waywhen you're fasting you can have tea andcoffee and all that but without the milkor cream you can add a little bit ofcoconut if you want coconut oil that isor m/c tol because that was that willgive you some satisfaction and take awayyour hunger for a while so that's veryimportant I want to say oh yes I want tosay this refeeding syndrome so let's sayyou one of you did decide to do a threeday or four day fast I warn you thatwhen you start eating again you may havea problem because what'll happen is thatif you have phosphate deficient becauseyou are nutritionally already eating thestandard American diet the set dial thenyou don't have enough phosphate in yourbody and your bones are the biggeststorage of phosphate and most of us haveosteopenia how come you have so muchjust opinion this 3000 women that cometo my office er a vast opinionhow come it's terrible living in Floridaall of us to fear it's terrible soobviously when she does her refeedingshe's gonna get phosphate deficiencybecause what happens all of a suddenstem cells going if they need buildingblocks and one of the building blocks isphosphate to replace the cells that havedied and so if you get faster so you gettremendous muscle weakness and muscleaching and that's from phosphatedeficiency and that can happen so whenthat happens you need to go and get someboneso all of you should know how to makesome room broth if you've made itIndians have been doing it for yearsbut you know just put some bones inthere and how to cook the bone broth youshould know how to make one now ifyou're rich then you can make it out ofvegetables too but it's very veryhelpful and even doing a fast if youabsolutely have to do anything you canhave some bone broth during a fast okaybone broth because it's got alot glycinein it and it's got phosphate it's got alot of minerals in it and that willreally help even the magnesium so it'llhelp you overcome some of your problemsto learn about bone broth and don't buyready-made bone broth make it yourselfby the way there's lots of recipes nowon the low-carb diet out what kind ofbreakfast lunch a donate whatever youwant to cook is available bone broth howto make it my favorite book that I useis Jason funds book right Jason Fong fung he's the is the nephrologist up inCanada and he sees all this reallyheavy-duty diabetics and he is it asamazing world but you see he's learnedall these tricks to make success so thepotassium can for magnesium can fall andphosphate so refeeding just be carefuluse bone broth during that time Ialready mentioned all the side effectswhich I okay coffee tea I mentioned thetea and black tea but medicines yes whenyou are when you're doing fasting itdepends which medicine now if you'retaking diabetes medications and I'mtelling you or if you're taking diabetesmedications they will cause a drop inyour sugar level and it could be adangerous dropping available especiallyincident should not be take them andglad you're right click beside thoseagents should not be taken but don't dothat without your physician knowingyou've got to involve your physician ifyour diabetic patient your physician isnobody if you're finishing doesn't wantto know about it and doesn't approve ofyou being fasting though maybe you needto find another one you see because andI look it's not bad I look physiciansare great but we taught to treat illnessget sick and I don't know what to dowith you but you want to stay healthyheck I don't know that's the problem wehave so it's not that they don't want tohelp you it's just that they don't knowthey've never been there to handle thatkind of situation I'll tell you what Ido with my patients ok I stop theinsulin right there normally insulin andI stop glad to ride or any other agentthat drops the blood sugar except formetformin I keep them on their phone andthen I tell them to measure the bloodsugars and for three days or two daysthey may have high blood sugar butthat's not going to hurt them that's notgoing to hurt them so if you look atwhat hurts you the most it's a highinsulin level that hurts you more ifyour glucose level is a little bit highokaythat'd make like ate some of yourproteins but it's temporary it's notgoing to hurt you in the long term butinsulin will hurt you so that's her goneand for most of them after their fastedthey feel a lot better and they they cancome off insulin they should be able tocome off in some but you can you knowthe trouble with physicians is andmyself included we're so busy thenideally I'd like to see you going on afast and then I'll see you today becausewe discussed it I'd like to see youagain in a couple of days at least nowif I'm going to stop your instant Imight want you to take a blood sugarevery day every day at least four timesand report to my office call the officetell the nurse my sugar is doing thisthat that and have a very closefollow-up on that trouble is that oursystem is so broken that most physicianscan't do that really if they try to dothat they'll go broke because there's noreimbursement for any of this stuff it'sreally terrible but that's what I'msayingkeep click find a physician that you canat least talk with frequently when seefrequently if you can't want to come offdiabetesoccasions now all the other medicationsblood pressure medication you shouldtake everything else but you measureyour blood pressure you gotta takethings into your own hands becausenobody is gonna do it except you youmust take control of your life we havebecome a society where we go to thedoctor and say fix me no you got to doit yourself you must take your bloodsugars every day get your ketone sticksover there get your blood pressuremachines start taking your bloodpressures if your preparation startsgoing below 100 you call the DA tales ofour prep it's just little Justin it'llbe our base attack oh no stop the baseattack good fine done and that's whathappens actually so it's hard to predictwho's going to talk the profession who'snot but generally speaking you gotta bevery vigilant and you need a doctor thatyou can quickly approach or a walk-inclinic that you can walk into that's whyI have of my walking clinic right peoplecan walk in and yeah the matter thatmight have to wait back please they'regonna be seen and if I'm tied up atleast my practitioners will take care ofthe patients so your blood pressure willdrop because you become volume depletedor because of of your physiologychanging the physiology is changing themso your blood pressure is dropping soyeah you can come off look high bloodpressure sugar high triglycerides andlow HDL are all part of metabolicsyndromethis makes metabolic syndrome betteryour your blood pressure will come downyes sugar will come down your tract thisedge will come down and your HDL will goup I told you all before that the lipidabnormalities that you see very few ofthem are primary lipid abnormalities therest are all reflections of your glucosemetabolism that has gone haywire so themost important things to look for onyour lipid panel is not your LDL it'syour triglycerides and HDL and the ratioof HDL to triglycerides if it's off youhave a sugar problem even though yoursugar is good or your hemoglobin a1c isgoodif your triglycerides are high and yourHDL low and the ratio is greatthan two you probably have like insulinlevels and that needs to be determinedand the treatment of high insulin levelstoday is fasterchanging your diet and doing intimatenow what do I do six months downloadpigeon comes to me says oh I've lost allthis weight look I feel great now I'mdown on my medications I'm hardly takinganything now I will repeat his insulinif they are good I'll say you know whatthings are much better now you don'thave to be so crazy about your dietanymore but automatically most of themstill do time to stick to feedingbecause they love it they feel so gooddoing it so there if you go back toeating five days five times a day youknow so you know so very important thatwe did this I wanted to mentionsomething else - yes so the you knowstudies are very hard in humans but Iwanted to show you one study that wasdone in monkeys about fasting so theytook the monkeys the rhesus monkeyswhich would be very closely related tothem they deserve more respect I thinkrhesus monkeys so they took theexperimental group gave them 30 percentless calories the standard teaching forfor weight loss 30 percent less caloriesright so 30 percent less calories andthe control group they gave them milkprotein corn oil sugar and unlimitedfeeding times pretty much like anAmerican dietthat is the control group and then whatthey did is they looked at the outcomeat five years in these deceased monkeysthere was 20% those who had restrictedcalories the 30% rested to terroriststhey lived 26% more than the controlgroup 50% less cardiovascular diseaseand greater than 90 percent no diabetesjust by cutting calories down our foodis so full of calories the more caloriesyou eat the more disease you're gonnaget this absolutely know that so now theNIH they don't want to be outdone sothey did a study they also did 30%caloric restriction but in the controlgroup now watch what they did in thecontrol group they gave them plantproteins no animal protein except forlittle bit of fish 5% fat only so wegave them some fat 4% sugar in theirdiet and they will only fed twice a dayand what did they find what do you thinkdetected that did those monkeys dobetter than the 30% caloric restrictionor do you think it was as good as thecaloric restriction they do better yeahso so again it's your diet so justsimply cutting down on 30% calories isnot the way to go it's no longercalories in calories out it's how yourbody reacts to the calories and whatcalories go in it's your hormonalresponse how you respond hormonal e andhow you respond to your geneticexpression so be careful what goes pastthe tongue because that's going todetermine your future and you know Ialways like questions and answers so I'mgoing to stop right there but today'smain message is if you want to do aserious fast talk to somebody who knowsa lot about fasting do it with somebodytalk to your doctor if you own diabetesmedications of bloodmedications if you want to simplyreplicate the Paleolithic way eat once aday or twice a day only do it in a timerestricted fashion all of you can do itall of ityou don't need medical permission to dothat the only time I'm telling you toseek my help is if you know three dayfive day or seven day water fast or evenmore water fastall right and there's a lot of booksthat you all can read especially Jasonthumb's book and and if there any otherquestions by the way as I said beforethis talk I'll put my slides in thereand then post it on to YouTube Galenfoundation wants to continue doing stufflike thisso my next one I'm gonna talk about allsorts of things including sleep over thewhole topic on sleep they're not beingwho improve your sleep this so I want todo that but you know Galen needs help asusual so any help you can give Galenfoundation is really it's a pepper 1/3 Cand if you know people who would like tohelp this type of organization ask themto help us out as well of course theycan come to our talks and our websitesas well
