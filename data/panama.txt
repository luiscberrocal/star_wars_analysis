Panama was inhabited by [[indigenous peoples of Panama|indigenous tribes]] before [[Spanish colonial empire|Spanish colonists]] arrived in the 16th century. It broke away from [[Spain]] in 1821 and joined the Republic of [[Gran Colombia]], a union of [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|Nueva Granada]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Venezuela]]. After Gran Colombia dissolved in 1831, Panama and Nueva Granada eventually became the Republic of Colombia. With the backing of the United States, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903, allowing the construction of the [[Panama Canal]] to be completed by the [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] between 1904 and 1914. The 1977 [[Torrijos–Carter Treaties]] agreed to transfer the canal from the United States to Panama on December 31, 1999.<ref name="cia">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/panama/ |title=Panama|work=CIA – The World Factbook |access-date=December 23, 2010}}</ref> The [[Panama Canal Zone|surrounding territory]] was first returned in 1979.<ref name="19770907_usdos_panamacanaltreaty">{{cite book|title=United States Treaties and Other International Agreements|chapter=Panama Canal Treaty|volume=33|page=55|publisher=United States Department of State|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n559BTeMBIsC&pg=PA39|author=Department of State, United States of America|date=1987|quote="Upon entry into force of this Treaty, the United States Government agencies known as the Panama Canal Company and the Canal Zone Government shall cease to operate within the territory of the Republic of Panama that formerly constituted the Canal Zone."|orig-year=Signed at Washington on September 7, 1977.

==Etymology==<!--linked-->
The definite origin of the name ''Panama'' is unknown. There are several theories. One states that the country was named after a commonly found species of tree (''[[Sterculia apetala]]'', the Panama tree). Another states that the first settlers arrived in Panama in August, when butterflies are abundant, and that the name means "many butterflies" in one or several of the [[Amerindian language|indigenous Amerindian language]]s that were spoken in the territory prior to [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization]]. Another theory states that the word is a [[castilianization]] of the [[Kuna language]] word "''bannaba''" which means "distant" or "far away".<ref name=PAN>{{cite web|url=http://www.pa/secciones/informacion/significado.html |title=Origen del Nombre Panamá |publisher=República de Panamá |access-date=July 25, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214054429/http://www.pa/secciones/informacion/significado.html |archive-date=February 14, 2007}}</ref>

A commonly relayed legend in Panama is that there was a fishing village that bore the name "Panamá", which purportedly meant "an abundance of fish", when the Spanish colonizers first landed in the area. The exact location of the village is unknown. The legend is usually corroborated by Captain Antonio Tello de Guzmán's diary entries, who reports landing at an unnamed village while exploring the Pacific coast of Panama in 1515; he only describes the village as a "same small indigenous fishing town". In 1517, Don [[Gaspar de Espinosa]], a Spanish lieutenant, decided to settle a post in the same location Guzmán described. In 1519, [[Pedrarias Dávila]] decided to establish the Spanish Empire's Pacific port at the site. The new settlement replaced [[Santa María la Antigua del Darién]], which had lost its function within the Crown's global plan after the Spanish exploitation of the riches in the Pacific began.

The official definition and origin of the name as promoted by Panama's Ministry of Education is the "abundance of fish, trees and butterflies". This is the usual description given in [[social studies]] textbooks.

{{Main|History of Panama}}
At the time of the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, the known inhabitants of Panama included the [[Cueva people|Cuevas]] and the [[Gran Coclé|Coclé]] tribes. These people have nearly disappeared, as they had no immunity from European infectious diseases.<ref>{{Cite book |last = Austin Alchon |first = Suzanne |title = A pest in the land: new world epidemics in a global perspective |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YiHHnV08ebkC&pg=PA67 |publisher = University of New Mexico Press |year = 2003 |pages = 67–74 |isbn = 0-8263-2871-7}}</ref>

The [[Isthmus of Panama]] was formed about three&nbsp;million years ago when the land bridge between North and South America finally became complete, and plants and animals gradually crossed it in both directions. The existence of the [[isthmus]] affected the dispersal of people, agriculture and technology throughout the American continent from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities.<ref name="Mayo, J 2004">Mayo, J.

''The Application of Phytolith Analysis to the Reconstruction of Plant Subsistence and Environments in Prehistoric Panama''. Dissertation, Temple University. Philadelphia, vol. 8 pp. 21–43.</ref>

The earliest discovered artifacts of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] in Panama include [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian]] [[projectile point]]s. Later central Panama was home to some of the first [[pottery]]-making in the Americas, for example the cultures at [[Monagrillo (archaeological site)|Monagrillo]], which date back to 2500–1700 BC. These evolved into significant populations best known through their spectacular burials (dating to c. 500–900 AD) at the [[Monagrillo (archaeological site)|Monagrillo]] [[archaeological site]], and their beautiful [[Gran Coclé]] style [[polychrome pottery]]. The monumental [[monolith]]ic sculptures at the [[Barriles]] (Chiriqui) site are also important traces of these ancient isthmian cultures.

Before Europeans arrived Panama was widely settled by [[Chibchan]], [[Chocoan]], and [[Cueva people|Cueva]] peoples. The largest group were the Cueva (whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented). The size of the [[Indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous]] population of the isthmus at the time of European colonization is uncertain. Estimates range as high as two million people, but more recent studies place that number closer to 200,000. Archaeological finds and testimonials by early European explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people developed{{clarify|date=August 2016|reason=Is this an anthropological term?}} by regular regional routes of commerce.

When Panama was colonized, the indigenous peoples fled into the forest and nearby islands. Scholars believe that [[infectious disease]] was the primary cause of the population decline of American natives. The indigenous peoples had no [[acquired immunity]] to diseases such as [[smallpox]] which had been chronic in Eurasian populations for centuries.<ref>Hays, J. N. (2005).

[[Rodrigo de Bastidas]] sailed westward from [[Venezuela]] in 1501 in search of gold, and became the first European to explore the isthmus of Panama. A year later, [[Christopher Columbus]] visited the isthmus, and established a short-lived settlement in the [[Darién Province|Darien]]. [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]]'s tortuous trek from the Atlantic to the Pacific in 1513 demonstrated that the isthmus was indeed the path between the seas, and Panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of Spain's empire in the [[New World]]. King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]] assigned [[Pedro Arias Dávila]] as Royal Governor. He arrived in June 1514 with a 19 vessels and 1,500 men. In 1519, Dávila founded [[Panama City]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Pedro Arias Dávila|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pedro-Arias-Davila|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> Gold and silver were brought by ship from South America, hauled across the isthmus, and loaded aboard ships for Spain. The route became known as the Camino Real, or Royal Road, although it was more commonly known as Camino de Cruces (Road of Crosses) because of the number of gravesites along the way.

Panama was under [[Spanish Empire|Spanish rule]] for almost 300 years (1538–1821), and became part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. From the outset, Panamanian identity was based on a sense of "geographic destiny", and Panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus. The colonial experience spawned Panamanian nationalism and a racially complex and highly stratified society, the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=La inmigración prohibida en Panamá y sus prejuicios raciales|last=Arango Durling |trans-title=Prohibited immigration in Panamá and its racial prejudices |first=Virginia |publisher=Publipan |year=1999 |lccn=2001388757 |location=Panamá  |language=es }}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

In 1538 the [[Real Audiencia of Panama]] was established, initially with [[jurisdiction]] from Nicaragua to [[Cape Horn]], until the conquest of Peru. A Real Audiencia was a judicial district that functioned as an appeals court. Each audiencia had an ''[[oidor]]'' (Spanish: hearer, a judge).

Spanish authorities had little control over much of the territory of Panama. Large sections managed to resist conquest and missionization until very late in the colonial era. Because of this, indigenous people of the area were often referred to as "indios de guerra" (war Indians) who resisted Spanish attempts to conquer them or missionize them. However, Panama was enormously important to Spain strategically because it was the easiest way to transship silver mined in Peru to Europe. Silver cargoes were landed at Panama and then taken overland to [[Portobelo, Colón|Portobello]] or [[Nombre de Dios, Colón|Nombre de Dios]] on the Caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment. Asides from the European route, there was also an Asian-American route, which led to traders and adventurers carrying silver from [[Peru]] going through Panama to reach Acapulco, Mexico before sailing to Manila, Philippines using the famed [[Manila Galleon]]s.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/44625493/Connecting_China_with_the_Pacific_World Connecting China with the Pacific World By Angela Schottenhammer](2019) (Page 144-145)</ref>

Because of incomplete Spanish control, the Panama route was vulnerable to attack from pirates (mostly Dutch and English), and from "new world" Africans called [[cimarron people (Panama)|cimarrons]] who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or ''palenques'' around the Camino Real in Panama's Interior, and on some of the islands off Panama's Pacific coast. One such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under [[Bayano]], which emerged in the 1552 to 1558. Sir [[Francis Drake]]'s famous raids on Panama in 1572–73 and [[John Oxenham]]'s crossing to the [[Pacific Ocean]] were aided by Panama cimarrons, and Spanish authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in 1582.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Pike, Ruth |title=Black Rebels: Cimarrons in Sixteenth Century Panama|journal=The Americas|volume= 64|issue=2 |year=2007|pages= 243–66|doi=10.1353/tam.2007.0161|s2cid=143773521}}</ref>

The prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries (1540–1740) while contributing to colonial growth; the placing of extensive regional judicial authority (Real Audiencia) as part of its jurisdiction; and the pivotal role it played at the height of the Spanish Empire – the first modern global empire – helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within Panama well before the rest of the colonies.

The end of the [[encomienda]] system in [[Azuero Peninsula|Azuero]], however, sparked the conquest of [[Veraguas]] in that same year. Under the leadership of Francisco Vázquez, the region of Veraguas passed into Castilian rule in 1558. In the newly conquered region, the old system of encomienda was imposed. On the other hand, the Panamanian movement for independence can be indirectly attributed to the abolition of the encomienda system in the [[Azuero Peninsula]], set forth by the Spanish Crown, in 1558 because of repeated protests by locals against the mistreatment of the native population. In its stead, a system of medium and smaller-sized landownership was promoted, thus taking away the power from the large landowners and into the hands of medium and small-sized proprietors.

Panama was the site of the ill-fated [[Darien scheme]], which set up a [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] colony in the region in 1698. This failed for a number of reasons, and the ensuing debt contributed to the [[Acts of Union 1707|union]] of England and Scotland in 1707.<ref>"[http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/Scotland-History/DarienScheme.htm The Darien Scheme – The Fall of Scotland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205194052/http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/Scotland-History/DarienScheme.htm |date=February 5, 2012 }}", Historic UK</ref>

In 1671, the [[privateer]] [[Henry Morgan]], licensed by the English government, sacked and burned the city of [[Panamá Viejo|Panama]] – the second most important city in the Spanish New World at the time. In 1717 the [[viceroyalty of New Granada]] (northern South America) was created in response to other Europeans trying to take Spanish territory in the Caribbean region. The Isthmus of Panama was placed under its jurisdiction. However, the remoteness of New Granada's capital, [[Santa Fe de Bogotá]] (the modern capital of [[Colombia]]) proved a greater obstacle than the Spanish crown anticipated as the authority of New Granada was contested by the seniority, closer proximity, and previous ties to the viceroyalty of Lima and even by Panama's own initiative. This uneasy relationship between Panama and Bogotá would persist for centuries.

In 1744, Bishop Francisco Javier de Luna Victoria DeCastro established the College of San Ignacio de Loyola and on June 3, 1749, founded La Real y Pontificia Universidad de San Javier. By this time, however, Panama's importance and influence had become insignificant as Spain's power dwindled in Europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted ships to round Cape Horn in order to reach the Pacific. While the Panama route was short it was also labor-intensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and laden-down trek required to get from the one coast to the other.

====1800s====

[[File:Arco chato.jpg|thumb|[[Santo Domingo Church]]]]
As the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] were heating up all across Latin America, Panama City was preparing for independence; however, their plans were accelerated by the unilateral Grito de La Villa de Los Santos (Cry From the Town of Saints), issued on November 10, 1821, by the residents of [[Azuero Peninsula|Azuero]] without backing from Panama City to declare their separation from the Spanish Empire. In both [[Veraguas]] and the capital this act was met with disdain, although on differing levels. To Veraguas, it was the ultimate act of treason, while to the capital, it was seen as inefficient and irregular, and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans.

Nevertheless, the Grito was a sign, on the part of the residents of Azuero, of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital. Those in the capital region in turn regarded the Azueran movement with contempt, since the separatists in Panama City believed that their counterparts in Azuero were fighting not only for independence from Spain, but also for their right to self-rule apart from Panama City once the Spaniards were gone.

It was seen as a risky move on the part of Azuero, which lived in fear of Colonel [[History of Panama#José de Fábrega|José Pedro Antonio de Fábrega y de las Cuevas]] (1774–1841). The colonel was a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus' military supplies in his hands. They feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists.

What they had counted on, however, was the influence of the separatists in the capital. Ever since October 1821, when the former Governor General, [[Juan de la Cruz Murgeón]], left the isthmus on a campaign in [[Quito]] and left a colonel in charge, the separatists had been slowly converting Fábrega to the separatist side. So, by November 10, Fábrega was now a supporter of the independence movement. Soon after the separatist declaration of Los Santos, Fábrega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the city's support for independence. No military repercussions occurred because of skillful bribing of royalist troops.

In the 80 years following independence from Spain, Panama was a [[Subdivisions of Gran Colombia|subdivision of Gran Colombia]], after voluntarily joining the country at the end of 1821.

The people of the isthmus made over 80 attempts to secede from Colombia. They came close to success in 1831, then again during the [[Thousand Days' War]] of 1899–1902, understood among indigenous Panamanians as a struggle for land rights under the leadership of Victoriano Lorenzo.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Müller-Schwarze|first1=Nina K.|title=The Blood of Victoriano Lorenzo: An Ethnography of the Cholos of Northern Coclé Province.|date=2015|publisher=McFarland Press|location=Jefferson, North Carolina}}</ref>

The US intent to influence the area, especially the [[Panama Canal]]'s construction and control, led to the [[separation of Panama from Colombia]] in 1903 and its establishment as a nation. When the [[Senate of Colombia]] rejected the [[Hay–Herrán Treaty]] on January 22, 1903, the United States decided to support and encourage the Panamanian separatist movement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.banrepcultural.org/node/86421 |title=Separación de Panamá: la historia desconocida |publisher=banrepcultural.org |access-date=April 9, 2016}}</ref><ref name="countrystudies">{{cite web |year=2009 |url = http://countrystudies.us/panama/8.htm|title = The 1903 Treaty and Qualified Independence|publisher = [[US Library of Congress]]|access-date = May 1, 2009 }}</ref>

In November 1903 Panama, tacitly supported by the United States, proclaimed its independence<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/junio2004/panama%20ultimo.htm |title=Panamá: el último año |publisher=banrepcultural.org |access-date=April 9, 2016}}</ref> and concluded the [[Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty]] with the United States without the presence of a single Panamanian. Philippe Bunau-Varilla, a French engineer and lobbyist represented Panama even though Panama's president and a delegation had arrived in New York to negotiate the treaty. The treaty was quickly drafted and signed the night before the Panamanian delegation arrived in Washington. Mr. Bunau-Varilla was in the employ of the French Canal company that had failed and was now bankrupt.
The treaty granted rights to the United States "as if it were sovereign" in a [[Panama Canal Zone|zone]] roughly {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|50|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} long. In that zone, the US would build a canal, then administer, fortify, and defend it "in perpetuity".

[[File:Panama Canal under construction, 1907.jpg|thumb|Construction work on the [[Gaillard Cut]] of the Panama Canal, 1907]]

In 1914 the United States completed the existing {{convert|83|km||adj=mid|abbr=off|-long|sp=us}} canal.

Because of the strategic importance of the canal during [[World War II]], the US [[Panama during World War II|extensively fortified access to it]].

From 1903 to 1968, Panama was a [[constitutional democracy]] dominated by a commercially oriented [[oligarchy]]. During the 1950s, the Panamanian military began to challenge the oligarchy's political hegemony. The early 1960s saw also the beginning of sustained pressure in Panama for the renegotiation of the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty, including riots that broke out in early 1964, resulting in widespread looting and dozens of deaths, and the evacuation of the American embassy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adst.org/2016/07/panama-riots-1964-beginning-end-canal/|title=The Panama Riots of 1964: The Beginning of the End for the Canal|date=July 19, 2016|access-date=November 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113025549/https://adst.org/2016/07/panama-riots-1964-beginning-end-canal/|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Amid negotiations for the Robles–Johnson treaty, Panama held elections in 1968. The candidates were:<ref name="Pizzurno Gelós 1989">Pizzurno Gelós, Patricia and Celestino Andrés Araúz (1996) ''Estudios sobre el Panamá Republicano (1903–1989)''. Colombia: Manfer S.A.</ref>
* Dr. [[Arnulfo Arias]] Madrid, Unión Nacional (National Union)
* Antonio González Revilla, [[People's Party (Panama)|Democracia Cristiana]] (Christian Democrats)
* Engr. David Samudio, Alianza del Pueblo (People's Alliance) who had the government's support.

Arias Madrid was declared the winner of elections that were marked by violence and accusations of fraud against Alianza del Pueblo. On October 1, 1968, Arias Madrid took office as president of Panama, promising to lead a government of "national union" that would end the reigning corruption and pave the way for a new Panama. A week and a half later, on October 11, 1968, the National Guard (Guardia Nacional) ousted Arias and initiated the downward spiral that would culminate with the United States' invasion in 1989. Arias, who had promised to respect the hierarchy of the National Guard, broke the pact and started a large restructuring of the Guard. To preserve the Guard's and his vested interests, Lieutenant Colonel [[Omar Torrijos]] Herrera and Major Boris Martínez commanded another military coup against a civilian government in Panamanian republican history. (The action was reminiscent of the 1940s when strong man Colonel Jose Remon removed three duly elected presidents. Remon finally ran for president himself in 1952. He controlled the National Guard which abused the opposition during the campaign and even stole election boxes on election day.)<ref name="Pizzurno Gelós 1989"/>

The military justified itself by declaring that Arias Madrid was trying to install a dictatorship, and promised a return to constitutional rule. In the meantime, the Guard began a series of populist measures that would gain support for the coup. Among them were:
* Price freezing on food, medicine and other goods<ref>Pizzurno Gelós, Patricia and Celestino Andrés Araúz (1996) ''Estudios sobre el Panamá Republicano (1903–1989)''. Colombia: Manfer S.A., p. 529.</ref> until January 31, 1969
* rent level freeze
* legalization of the permanence of squatting families in boroughs surrounding the historic site of Panama Viejo<ref name="Pizzurno Gelós 1989"/>
Parallel to this, the military began a policy of repression against the opposition, who were labeled communists. The military appointed a Provisional Government Junta that was to arrange new elections. However, the National Guard would prove to be very reluctant to abandon power and soon began calling itself '''El Gobierno Revolucionario''' ('''The Revolutionary Government''').

====Post-1970====
[[File:Omar Torrijos with Panamanian farmers.jpg|thumb|[[Omar Torrijos]] (right) with farmers in the Panamanian countryside. The Torrijos government was well known for its policies of [[land redistribution]].]]

Under [[Omar Torrijos]]'s control, the military transformed the political and economic structure of the country, initiating massive coverage of social security services and expanding public education.

The constitution was changed in 1972. To reform the constitution, the military created a new organization, the Assembly of Corregimiento Representatives, which replaced the National Assembly. The new assembly, also known as the Poder Popular (Power of the People), was composed of 505 members selected by the military with no participation from political parties, which the military had eliminated. The new constitution proclaimed [[Omar Torrijos]] as the Maximum Leader of the Panamanian Revolution, and conceded him unlimited power for six years, although, to keep a façade of constitutionality, [[Demetrio B. Lakas]] was appointed president for the same period.<ref name="Pizzurno Gelós 1989"/>

In 1981, Torrijos died in a plane crash.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/02/obituaries/panama-leader-killed-in-crash-in-bad-weather.html|title=PANAMA LEADER KILLED IN CRASH IN BAD WEATHER|last=International|first=United Press|access-date=June 1, 2018|language=en}}</ref> Torrijos' death altered the tone of Panama's political evolution. Despite the 1983 constitutional amendments which proscribed a political role for the military, the [[Panama Defense Forces|Panama Defense Force]] (PDF), as they were then known, continued to dominate Panamanian political life. By this time, General [[Manuel Noriega|Manuel Antonio Noriega]] was firmly in control of both the PDF and the civilian government.{{when|date=May 2016}}

[[File:Jimmy Carter and General Omar Torrijos signing the Panama Canal Treaty.jpg|thumb|US President [[Jimmy Carter]] shakes hands with General [[Omar Torrijos]] after signing the [[Torrijos–Carter Treaties|Panama Canal Treaties]] (September 7, 1977).]]
In the 1984 elections, the candidates were
* [[Nicolás Ardito Barletta Vallarino]], supported by the military in a union called UNADE
* Arnulfo Arias Madrid, for the opposition union ADO
* ex-General [[Rubén Darío Paredes]], who had been forced to an early retirement by Noriega, running for Partido Nacionalista Popular PNP ("Popular Nationalist Party")
* Carlos Iván Zúñiga, running for Partido Acción Popular (PAPO) meaning "Popular Action Party"
Barletta was declared the winner of elections that had been clearly won by Arias. Ardito Barletta inherited a country in economic ruin and hugely indebted to the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]]. Amid the economic crisis and Barletta's efforts to calm the country's creditors, street protests arose, and so did military repression.

Meanwhile, Noriega's regime had fostered a well-hidden criminal economy that operated as a parallel source of income for the military and their allies, providing revenues from drugs and [[money laundering]]. Toward the end of the military dictatorship, a new wave of Chinese migrants arrived on the isthmus in the hope of migrating to the United States. The smuggling of Chinese became an enormous business, with revenues of up to 200 million dollars for Noriega's regime (see Mon 167).<ref>Mon Pinzón, Ramón Arturo (1979). ''Historia de la Migración China Durante la Construcción del Ferrocarril de Panamá''. Masters Thesis. México: El Colegio de México.</ref>

The military dictatorship assassinated or tortured more than one hundred Panamanians and forced at least a hundred more dissidents into exile. (see Zárate 15).<ref>Zárate, Abdiel (November 9, 2003). "Muertos y desaparecidos durante la época militar." Extra-centennial issue of ''La Prensa''.</ref> Noriega's regime was supported by the United States and it began playing a double role in Central America. While the [[Contadora group]], an initiative launched by the foreign ministers of various Latin American nations including Panama's, conducted diplomatic efforts to achieve peace in the region, Noriega supplied Nicaraguan [[Contras]] and other guerrillas in the region with weapons and ammunition on behalf of the CIA.<ref name="Pizzurno Gelós 1989"/>

On June 6, 1987, the recently retired Colonel Roberto Díaz Herrera, resentful that Noriega had broken the agreed-upon "Torrijos Plan" of succession that would have made him the chief of the military after Noriega, decided to denounce the regime. He revealed details of electoral fraud{{clarify|date=May 2016}}, accused Noriega of planning Torrijos's death and declared that Torrijos had received 12 million dollars from the Shah of Iran for giving the exiled Iranian leader asylum. He also accused Noriega of the assassination by decapitation of then-opposition leader, Dr. [[Hugo Spadafora]].<ref name="Pizzurno Gelós 1989"/>{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

On the night of June 9, 1987, the Cruzada Civilista ("Civic Crusade") was created {{where|date=May 2016}} and began organizing actions of civil disobedience. The Crusade called for a general strike. In response, the military suspended constitutional rights and declared a state of emergency in the country. On July 10, the [[Civic Crusade]] called for a massive demonstration that was violently repressed by the "Dobermans", the military's special riot control unit. That day, later known as El Viernes Negro ("Black Friday"), left six hundred people injured and another six hundred detained, many of whom were later tortured and raped.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

United States President [[Ronald Reagan]] began a series of sanctions against the military regime. The United States froze economic and military assistance to Panama in the middle of 1987 in response to the domestic political crisis in Panama and an attack on the US embassy. The sanctions failed to oust Noriega, but severely hurt Panama's economy. Panama's gross domestic product (GDP) declined almost 25 percent between 1987 and 1989.<ref name="Acosta, Coleen 2008">Acosta, Coleen (October 24, 2008).

''Journals of the Stanford Course on Prejudice and Poverty''.</ref>

On February 5, 1988, General Manuel Antonio Noriega was accused of drug trafficking by federal juries in Tampa and Miami. [[Human Rights Watch]] wrote in its 1989 report: "Washington turned a blind eye to abuses in Panama for many years until concern over drug trafficking prompted indictments of the general [Noriega] by two grand juries in Florida in February 1988".<ref name="Panama">[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1989/WR89/Panama.htm "Panama"]. ''Human Rights Watch World Report 1989''. hrw.org</ref>

In April 1988, US President Ronald Reagan invoked the [[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]], freezing Panamanian government assets in all US organizations. In May 1989 Panamanians voted overwhelmingly for the anti-Noriega candidates. The Noriega regime promptly annulled the election and embarked on a new round of repression.

The United States invaded Panama on December 20, 1989, codenamed [[Operation Just Cause]]. The U.S. stated the operation was "necessary to safeguard the lives of U.S. citizens in Panama, defend democracy and human rights, combat drug trafficking, and secure the neutrality of the [[Panama Canal]] as required by the [[Torrijos–Carter Treaties]]".<ref>''New York Times''.

===Post-intervention era===
Panama's Electoral Tribunal moved quickly to restore civilian constitutional government, reinstated the results of the May 1989 election on December 27, 1989, and confirmed the victory of President [[Guillermo Endara]] and Vice Presidents [[Guillermo Ford]] and [[Ricardo Arias Calderón]].

During its five-year term, the often-fractious government struggled to meet the public's high expectations. Its new police force was a major improvement over its predecessor but was not fully able to deter crime. [[Ernesto Pérez Balladares]] was sworn in as president on September 1, 1994, after an internationally monitored election campaign.

Perez Balladares ran as the candidate for a three-party coalition dominated by the [[Democratic Revolutionary Party]] (PRD), the erstwhile political arm of military dictatorships. Perez Balladares worked skillfully during the campaign to rehabilitate the PRD's image, emphasizing the party's populist Torrijos roots rather than its association with Noriega. He won the election with only 33 percent of the vote when the major non-PRD forces splintered into competing factions. His administration carried out economic reforms and often worked closely with the US on implementation of the Canal treaties.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

On September 1, 1999, [[Mireya Moscoso]], the widow of former President [[Arnulfo Arias Madrid]], took office after defeating PRD candidate [[Martín Torrijos]], son of [[Omar Torrijos]], in a free and fair election.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/panama/moscoso.htm|title=Moscoso wins victory in Panama's presidential vote|website=www.latinamericanstudies.org}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/panama/95380.htm|title=Panama (11/07)|publisher=US Department of State|access-date=April 2, 2017}}</ref> During her administration, Moscoso attempted to strengthen social programs, especially for child and youth development, protection, and general welfare.

He formed a National Anti-Corruption Council whose members represented the highest levels of government and civil society, labor organizations, and religious leadership.

Despite the Torrijos administration's public stance on corruption, many high-profile cases,{{clarify|date=May 2016}} particularly involving political or business elites, were never acted upon.

==Geography==
[[File:Pm-map.png|upright=1.5|thumb|A map of Panama]]
{{Main|Geography of Panama}}
[[File:La palma, Darién.jpg|thumb|La Palma, Darién]]
Panama is located in Central America, bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, between Colombia and Costa Rica. It mostly lies between latitudes [[7th parallel north|7°]] and [[10th parallel north|10°N]], and longitudes [[77th meridian west|77°]] and [[83rd meridian west|83°W]] (a small area lies west of 83°).

Its location on the [[Isthmus of Panama]] is strategic. By 2000, Panama controlled the [[Panama Canal]] which connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea to the north of the Pacific Ocean. Panama's total area is {{cvt|74,177.3|km2}}.<ref name=area>{{cite web |url=https://www.contraloria.gob.pa/inec/archivos/P6221DATOS%20GENERALES%20%20%20%202013.pdf |title=Datos generales e históricos de la República de Panamá |language=es |publisher=[[National Institute of Statistics and Census of Panama|INEC]] |access-date=December 22, 2015}}</ref>

The dominant feature of Panama's geography is the central spine of mountains and hills that forms the [[continental divide]]. The divide does not form part of the great mountain chains of North America, and only near the Colombian border are there highlands related to the [[Andes|Andean]] system of South America. The spine that forms the divide is the highly eroded arch of an uplift from the sea bottom, in which peaks were formed by volcanic intrusions.

The mountain range of the divide is called the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]] near the Costa Rican border. Farther east it becomes the Serranía de Tabasará, and the portion of it closer to the lower saddle of the isthmus, where the Panama Canal is located, is often called the Sierra de Veraguas. As a whole, the range between Costa Rica and the canal is generally referred to by geographers as the [[Cordillera Central, Costa Rica|Cordillera Central]].

The highest point in the country is the [[Volcán Barú]], which rises to {{convert|3,475|m|abbr=off}}. A nearly impenetrable jungle forms the [[Darién Gap]] between Panama and Colombia where Colombian [[guerrilla]]s and drug dealers operate and sometimes take [[hostage-taking|hostages]]. This and unrest, and [[forest protection]] movements, create a break in the [[Pan-American Highway]], which otherwise forms a complete road from [[Alaska]] to [[Patagonia]].

Panama's wildlife is the most diverse in Central America. It is home to many South American species as well as to North American wildlife.

[[File:chagres.jpg|thumb|The [[Chagres River]]]]

===Waterways===
{{main|Panama Canal}}
Nearly 500 rivers lace Panama's rugged landscape. Mostly unnavigable, many originate as swift highland streams, meander in valleys, and form coastal deltas. However, the [[Río Chagres]] (''Chagres River''), located in central Panama, is one of the few wide rivers and a source of [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power. The central part of the river is dammed by the [[Gatun Dam]] and forms [[Gatun Lake]], an [[artificial lake]] that constitutes part of the [[Panama Canal]]. The lake was created by the construction of the Gatun Dam across the Río Chagres between 1907 and 1913. Once created, Gatun Lake was the largest man-made lake in the world, and the dam was the largest earth dam. The river drains northwest into the Caribbean. The Kampia and Madden Lakes (also filled from the Río Chagres) provide hydroelectricity for the area of the former Canal Zone.

The Río Chepo, another source of hydroelectric power, is one of the more than 300 rivers emptying into the Pacific. These Pacific-oriented rivers are longer and slower-running than those on the Caribbean side. Their basins are also more extensive. One of the longest is the [[Río Tuira]], which flows into the [[Golfo de San Miguel]] and is the nation's only river that is navigable by larger vessels.

===Harbors===
The Caribbean coastline is marked by several natural harbors. However, Cristóbal, at the Caribbean terminus of the canal, had the only important port facilities in the late 1980s. The numerous islands of the Archipiélago de Bocas del Toro, near the Beaches of Costa Rica, provide an extensive natural roadstead and shield the banana port of [[Almirante, Bocas del Toro|Almirante]]. The more than 350 [[San Blas Islands]] near Colombia, are strung out over more than {{convert|160|km|abbr=off}} along the sheltered Caribbean coastline.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Panama}}
[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map PAN present.svg|thumb|Panama map of Köppen climate classification]]
[[File:VistaBoquete.jpg|thumb|A cooler climate is common in the Panamanian highlands.]]
Panama has a tropical climate. Temperatures are uniformly high—as is the relative humidity—and there is little seasonal variation. [[Diurnal temperature variation|Diurnal ranges]] are low; on a typical dry-season day in the capital city, the early morning minimum may be {{convert|24|°C|1}} and the afternoon maximum {{convert|30|°C|1}}. The temperature seldom exceeds {{convert|32|°C|1}} for more than a short time. Temperatures on the Pacific side of the isthmus are somewhat lower than on the Caribbean, and breezes tend to rise after dusk in most parts of the country. Temperatures are markedly cooler in the higher parts of the mountain ranges, and frosts occur in the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]] in western Panama.

Climatic regions are determined less on the basis of temperature than on [[rain]]fall, which varies regionally from less than {{convert|1300|mm|in|1|sp=us}} to more than {{convert|3000|mm|in|1|sp=us}} per year. Almost all of the rain falls during the rainy season, which is usually from April to December, but varies in length from seven to nine months. In general, rainfall is much heavier on the Caribbean than on the Pacific side of the [[continental divide]]. The annual average in Panama City is little more than half of that in Colón. Although rainy-season thunderstorms are common, the country is outside the [[hurricane belt]].

===Biodiversity===
Panama's tropical environment supports an abundance of plants. Forests dominate, interrupted in places by grasslands, scrub, and crops. Although nearly 40% of Panama is still wooded, [[deforestation]] is a continuing threat to the rain-drenched woodlands. Tree cover has been reduced by more than 50 percent since the 1940s. Subsistence farming, widely practised from the northeastern jungles to the southwestern grasslands, consists largely of corn, bean, and tuber plots. [[Mangrove swamp]]s occur along parts of both coasts, with banana plantations occupying deltas near Costa Rica. In many places, a multi-canopied [[rain forest]] abuts the swamp on one side of the country and extends to the lower reaches of slopes on the other. Panama had a 2019 [[Forest Landscape Integrity Index]] mean score of 6.37/10, ranking it 78th globally out of 172 countries.<ref name="FLII-Supplementary">{{cite journal|last1=Grantham|first1=H.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Panama}}

[[File:Asamblea Nacional de Panamá.JPG|thumb|The [[National Assembly of Panama]]]]
Panama's politics take place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic, whereby the [[President of Panama]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[National Assembly of Panama|National Assembly]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

National elections are universal for all citizens 18 years and older. National elections for the executive and legislative branches take place every five years. Members of the judicial branch (justices) are appointed by the head of state. Panama's [[National Assembly of Panama|National Assembly]] is elected by proportional representation in fixed electoral districts, so many smaller parties are represented. Presidential elections require a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]]; out of the five last presidents only ex-president Ricardo Martinelli has managed to be elected with over 50 percent of the popular vote.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8031425.stm Tycoon elected Panama's president] Retrieved July 25, 2010</ref>

===Political culture===
Since the end of [[Manuel Noriega]]'s military dictatorship in 1989, Panama has successfully completed five peaceful transfers of power to opposing political factions. The political landscape is dominated by two major parties and many smaller parties, many of which are driven by individual leaders more than ideologies. Former President [[Martín Torrijos]] is the son of general [[Omar Torrijos]]. He succeeded [[Mireya Moscoso]], the widow of [[Arnulfo Arias]]. Panama's most recent [[2019 Panamanian general election|national elections occurred in 2019]]. The [[2019 Panamanian general election]] were scheduled for May 5, 2019, with current President [[Juan Carlos Varela]] being ineligible due to constitutional limits for a second term.

===Foreign relations===

[[File:John Kerry con Juan Carlos Varela e Isabel Saint Malo.jpg|thumb|left|Panama's President-elect [[Juan Carlos Varela]] and Vice President [[Isabel Saint Malo]] with US Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] just before Varela's inauguration in 2014]]

The United States cooperates with the Panamanian government in promoting economic, political, security, and social development through US and international agencies. Cultural ties between the two countries are strong, and many Panamanians go to the United States for higher education and advanced training.

===Military===
{{Further|Panamanian Public Forces}}
{{More citations needed section|date=November 2020}}
Shortly after its independence from Colombia in 1903, Panama abolished its army. It maintained police operations throughout the nation. During the 1940s the Chief of Police of Panama City, Jose Remon, exercised pronounced political power in Panama. He removed and appointed several presidents. In 1952 he ran for president. The campaign was marred by police brutality and persecution of the opposition. As a result, questioned by independent observers, Remon was declared the president. Less than three years later Remon was assassinated. The only president ever assassinated. Today the [[Panamanian Public Forces]] are the national security forces of Panama. Panama is the second country in Latin America (the other being [[Costa Rica]]) to permanently abolish its standing army. Panama maintains armed police and security forces, and small air and maritime forces. They are tasked with law enforcement and can perform limited military actions.

In 2017, Panama signed the UN [[treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;– No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=July 7, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Panama adheres to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |url=https://www.panamatoday.com/panama/panama-adheres-treaty-prohibition-nuclear-weapons-5273 |work=Panama Today |date=September 20, 2017 |access-date=August 15, 2019 |archive-date=August 15, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815123543/https://www.panamatoday.com/panama/panama-adheres-treaty-prohibition-nuclear-weapons-5273 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

{{Main|Provinces and regions of Panama}}
Panama is divided into ten provinces with their respective local authorities (governors). Each is divided into [[districts of Panama|districts]] and [[corregimientos of panama|''corregimientos'']] (townships). Also, there are five ''Comarcas'' (literally: "Shires") populated by a variety of indigenous groups.

Even though Panama is regarded as a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income country]], it still remains a country of stark contrasts perpetuated by dramatic educational disparities. Between 2015 and 2017, poverty at US$5.5 fell from 15.4 to an estimated 14.1 percent.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/panama/overview|work= worldbank.org |title= Panama Overview}}</ref>

===Economic sectors===
Panama's economy, because of its key geographic location, is mainly based on a well-developed service sector, especially commerce, tourism, and trading. The handover of the Canal and military installations by the United States has given rise to large construction projects.

A project to build a third set of locks for the Panama Canal A was overwhelmingly approved in a referendum (with low voter turnout, however) on October 22, 2006. The official estimated cost of the project is US$5.25 billion, but the canal is of major economic importance because it provides millions of dollars of toll [[revenue]] to the national economy and provides massive employment. Transfer of control of the Canal to the Panamanian government completed in 1999, after 85 years of US control.

Copper and gold deposits are being developed by foreign investors, to the dismay of some environmental groups, as all of the projects are located within protected areas.<ref>Oancea, Dan (January 2009).

Because of the tie to US dollars, Panama has traditionally had low [[inflation]]. According to the [[Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]], Panama's inflation in 2006 was 2.0 percent as measured by a weighted [[Consumer Price Index]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cepal.org/publicaciones/xml/2/27542/Anexo_estadistico.pdf |title=CEPAL.org |access-date=June 26, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824191044/http://www.cepal.org/publicaciones/xml/2/27542/Anexo_estadistico.pdf |archive-date=August 24, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The balboa replaced the [[Colombian peso]] in 1904 after Panama's independence. Balboa banknotes were printed in 1941 by President Arnulfo Arias. They were recalled several days later, giving them the name "The Seven Day Dollars". The notes were burned by the new government, but occasionally balboa notes can be found in collections. These were the only banknotes ever issued by Panama and US notes have circulated both before and since.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===International trade===
The high levels of Panamanian trade are in large part from the [[Colón Free Trade Zone]], the largest free trade zone in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. Last year the zone accounted for 92 percent of Panama's exports and 64 percent of its imports, according to an analysis of figures from the Colon zone management and estimates of Panama's trade by the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]]. Panama's economy is also very much supported by the trade and export of coffee and other agricultural products.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) between the governments of the United States and Panama was signed on October 27, 1982. The treaty protects US investment and assists Panama in its efforts to develop its economy by creating conditions more favorable for US private investment and thereby strengthening the development of its private sector. The BIT was the first such treaty signed by the US in the Western Hemisphere.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tcc.export.gov/Trade_Agreements/Bilateral_Investment_Treaties/index.asp |title=List of BITs currently in effect |publisher=Tcc.export.gov |access-date=June 26, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709145249/http://tcc.export.gov/Trade_Agreements/Bilateral_Investment_Treaties/index.asp |archive-date=July 9, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A [[Panama–United States Trade Promotion Agreement]] (TPA) was signed in 2007, approved by Panama on July 11, 2007, and by US President Obama on October 21, 2011, and the agreement entered into force on October 31, 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://trade.gov/mas/ian/tradeagreements/fta/tg_ian_002427.asp |title=The United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA) |publisher=trade.gov |access-date=October 31, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113033819/http://trade.gov/mas/ian/tradeagreements/fta/tg_ian_002427.asp |archive-date=November 13, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Ethnic groups===
[[File:Panama 08 2013 Ave Balboa 7044.JPG|thumb|[[Panama City]], Panama's capital]]

In 2010 the population was 65 percent [[Mestizo]] (mixed white, Native American), 12.3 percent Native American, 9.2 percent Black or African descent, 6.8 percent mulatto, and 6.7 percent White.<ref name="cia"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/panama/|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|date=December 2, 2021}}</ref>

Ethnic groups in Panama include [[Mestizo]] people, who are a mix of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] and Amerindian ancestry. [[Afro-Panamanians]] account for 15–20 percent of the population. Most Afro-Panamanians live on the Panama-[[Colón, Panama|Colón]] metropolitan area, the Darien Province, [[La Palma, Panama|La Palma]], and [[Bocas Del Toro]]. Neighborhoods in Panama City that have large black populations include: Curundu, El Chorrillo, Rio Abajo, San Joaquín, El Marañón, San Miguelito, and Santa Ana.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Black Panamanians are descendants of African slaves brought to the Americas in the [[Atlantic Slave Trade]]. The second wave of black people brought to Panama came from the Caribbean during the construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. Panama also has a considerable [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and Indian ([[India]]) population brought to work on the canal during its construction. Most [[Chinese-Panamanians]] reside in the province of [[Chiriquí Province|Chiriquí]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Europeans and [[white-Panamanians]] are a minority in Panama. Panama is also home to a small Arab community that has [[mosques]], practises [[Islam]], as well as a Jewish community and many synagogues.

The Amerindian population includes seven ethnic groups: the [[Ngäbe people|Ngäbe]], [[Kuna people|Kuna]] (Guna), [[Emberá people|Emberá]], [[Bokota people|Buglé]], [[Wounaan]], [[Naso people|Naso Tjerdi]] (Teribe), and [[Bribri people|Bri Bri]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwgia.org/regions/latin-america/panama/887-update-2011-panama |title=Update 2011 – Panama |publisher=Iwgia.org |access-date=June 15, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307063455/http://www.iwgia.org/regions/latin-america/panama/887-update-2011-panama |archive-date=March 7, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Panama}}
During the 16th century, education in Panama was provided by [[Jesuit]]s. Public education began as a national and governmental institution in 1903. The principle underlying the early education system was that children should receive different types of education in accordance with their social class and therefore the position they were expected to occupy in society.

[[Public education]] began in Panama soon after it seceded from Colombia in 1903. The first efforts were guided by an extremely paternalistic view of the goals of education, as evidenced in comments made in a 1913 meeting of the First Panamanian Educational Assembly, "The cultural heritage given to the child should be determined by the social position he will or should occupy. For this reason education should be different in accordance with the social class to which the student should be related." This elitist focus changed rapidly under US influence.<ref name="cs">{{Country study|country=Panama|abbr=pa|editor=Sandra W. Meditz and Dennis M. Hanratty|date=December 1987|section=Education|author=Kluck, Patricia}}</ref>

In 2010, it was estimated that 94.1 percent of the population was literate (94.7 percent of males and 93.5 percent of females).<ref name="cia.gov">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/panama/|title=The World Factbook|access-date=October 25, 2014}}</ref> Education in Panama is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] for all children between ages 6 and 15. In recent decades, school enrollment at all levels, but especially at upper levels, has increased significantly. Panama participates in the [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA]] exams, but due to debts and unsatisfactory exam results it postponed participation until 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://impresa.prensa.com/panorama/Panama-pruebas-Pisa_0_4006849352.html |title=Panamá sin pruebas Pisa hasta 2018 |date=August 18, 2014 |publisher=Impresa.prensa.com |access-date=April 9, 2016}}</ref>

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Panama}}
{{See also|Music of Panama}}
[[File:Erika_Ender_pic_by_Raymond_Collazo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Erika Ender]]]]

The culture of Panama derives from [[Music of Europe|European music]], [[European art|art]] and traditions brought by the Spanish to Panama. [[Hegemonic]] forces have created [[Cross-genre|hybrid]] forms blending [[Culture of Africa|African]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] culture with [[Culture of Europe|European culture]]. For example, the ''[[tamborito]]'' is a Spanish dance with African rhythms, themes and dance moves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://panama-culture.com/ |title=The online almanac of Panama culture with travel links |publisher=Panama Culture |access-date=December 23, 2010}}</ref>

Dance is typical of the diverse cultures in Panama. The local folklore can be experienced at a multitude of festivals, through dances and traditions handed down from generation to generation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vacationtopanama.com/travel-guide/cultural-melting-pot/|title=Panama Culture and Traditions, a True Melting Pot of Mesoamerica|website=Panama Vacations|language=en-US|access-date=February 22, 2020}}</ref> Local cities host live ''[[reggae en español]]'', ''[[reggaeton]]'', ''haitiano ([[compas]])'', [[jazz]], [[blues]], ''[[salsa music|salsa]]'', [[reggae]], and [[rock music]] performances.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Handicraft===
Outside Panama City, regional festivals take place throughout the year featuring local musicians and dancers. Panama's blended culture is reflected in traditional products, such as [[woodcarving]]s, ceremonial masks and [[pottery]], as well as in Panama's architecture, cuisine and festivals. In earlier times, baskets were woven for utilitarian uses, but now many villages rely almost exclusively on income from the baskets they produce for tourists.

An example of undisturbed, unique culture in Panama is that of the [[Guna Yala|Guna]] who are known for ''[[mola (art form)|molas]]''. ''Mola'' is the Guna word for blouse, but the term ''mola'' has come to mean the elaborate embroidered panels made by Guna women, that make up the front and back of a Guna woman's blouse. They are several layers of cloth, varying in color, that are loosely stitched together, made using a reverse [[appliqué]] process.

===Holidays and festivities===
{{Further|Public holidays in Panama}}

The Christmas parade, known as ''El desfile de Navidad'', is celebrated in the capital, Panama City. This holiday is celebrated on December 25. The floats in the parade are decorated in the Panamanian colors, and women wear dresses called ''[[pollera]]'' and men dress in traditional montuno. In addition, the marching band in the parade, consisting of drummers, keeps crowds entertained. In the city, a big Christmas tree is lit with Christmas lights, and everybody surrounds the tree and sings Christmas carols.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs|date=June 23, 2010|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2030.htm|title=Panama}}</ref>

===Traditional cuisine===
{{Further|Panamanian cuisine}}
Since Panama's cultural heritage is influenced by many ethnicities the traditional cuisine of the country includes ingredients from many cultures, from all over the world:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.premiercasa.com/en/panama/panama-guide/a-guide-to-panama-food-culture|title=A Guide to Panama Food Culture|website=www.premiercasa.com}}</ref>
a mix of African, Spanish, and Native American techniques, dishes, and ingredients, reflecting its diverse population. Since Panama is a land bridge between two continents, it has a large variety of tropical fruits, vegetables and herbs that are used in native cooking.
The famous fish market known as the "Mercado de Mariscos" offers fresh seafood and [[Ceviche]], a seafood dish. Small shops along the street which are called kiosco and [[Empanada]], which is a typical latinamerican pastry, including a variety of different ingredients, either with meat or vegetarian, mostly fried. Another kind of pastry is the [[pastelito]], with the only difference in comparison to [[empanada]]s is that they are bigger.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Typical Panamanian foods are mild-flavored, without the pungency of some of Panama's Latin American and Caribbean neighbors. Common ingredients are [[maize]], [[rice]], [[wheat]] flour, [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, ''yuca'' ([[cassava]]), beef, chicken, pork and seafood.

===Traditional clothing===
[[File:Tuna panama.jpg|thumb|A couple dancing Panamanian Cumbia]]
Panamanian men's traditional clothing, called ''montuno'', consists of white cotton shirts, trousers and woven straw hats.

The traditional women's clothing is the ''pollera''. It originated in Spain in the 16th century, and by the early 1800s it was typical in Panama, worn by female servants, especially wet nurses (''De Zarate'' 5). Later, it was adopted by upper-class women.

A ''pollera'' is made of "[[cambric]]" or "fine linen" (Baker 177). It is white, and is usually about 13 yards of material.

The original ''pollera'' consists of a ruffled blouse worn off the shoulders and a skirt with gold buttons. The skirt is also ruffled, so that when it is lifted up, it looks like a peacock's tail or a ''[[mantilla]]'' fan. The designs on the skirt and blouse are usually flowers or birds. Two large matching [[pom pom]]s (''mota'') are on the front and back, four ribbons hang from the front and back from the waist, five gold chains (''caberstrillos'') hang from the neck to the waist, a gold cross or medallion on a black ribbon is worn as a [[choker]], and a silk purse is worn at the waistline. Earrings (''zaricillos'') are usually gold or coral. Slippers usually match the color of the ''pollera''. Hair is usually worn in a bun, held by three large gold combs that have pearls (''tembleques'') worn like a crown. Quality ''pollera'' can cost up to $10,000, and may take a year to complete.

Today, there are different types of ''polleras''; the ''pollera de gala'' consists of a short-sleeved ruffle skirt blouse, two full-length skirts and a [[petticoat]]. Girls wear ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20170518133519/http://panamafolktembleques.com/ tembleques]'' in their hair. Gold coins and jewelry are added to the outfit. The ''pollera montuna'' is a daily dress, with a blouse, a skirt with a solid color, a single gold chain, and pendant earrings and a natural flower in the hair. Instead of an off-the-shoulder blouse it is worn with a fitted white jacket that has shoulder pleats and a flared hem.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726000349/http://discoverytheater.org/education/guides/2010/Celebremos%20Panama!%20Resource%20Guide.pdf Celebremos Panama!].

Traditional clothing in Panama can be worn in parades, where the females and males do a traditional dance. Females gently sway and twirl their skirts, while men hold their hats in their hands and dance behind the females.

The US influence in Panama can be seen in the country's sports. Baseball is Panama's national sport. The [[Panamanian Professional Baseball League]] is the country's professional winter league. It was first held in 1946, but had multiple interruptions spanning several decades. The [[Panama national baseball team]] has earned one silver medal and two bronze medals at the [[Baseball World Cup]].
